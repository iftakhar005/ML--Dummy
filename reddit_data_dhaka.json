        "body":"Hi everyone,  \nYesterday, my phone (Google Pixel 7 Pro) was stolen from my pocket while I was getting into the train at Airport Railway Station. I filed a GD at Airport Railway Station Thana, but I’m not sure what else I can do now to try to recover it.\n\nMy biggest concern is unauthorized access to my personal data. I’ve already taken the following steps today:\n\n* Reissued my SIM\n* Signed out of all Google accounts\n* Logged out of apps like WhatsApp and other services\n* Locked the device from my Google account\n\nStill, I’m worried if there’s anything more I should do to protect my data or increase the chance of getting the phone back.\n\nIf anyone has experience with similar cases or knows the proper steps to take in Dhaka, I would really appreciate your guidance.  \nSpecifically:\n\n* Any realistic ways to track or recover a stolen phone here?\n* Whether contacting the mobile operator or Google support helps in any way\n* How to effectively follow up with the thana to improve recovery chances\n* Any additional precautions to secure my data\n\nAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\n  \nI also used GPT to refine this post so that I can clearly explain my situation.\\*",

        "body":"After the earthquakes that hit Bangladesh in the last 2 days News outlets have started over exaggerating the threat. They are capitalizing on people's fear. I saw one outlet literally saying there can be magnitude 9 earthquakes in Bangladesh. First of all this is total vogus. Bangladesh does not have the type of subduction zone needed for magnitude 9 earthquakes. So it is highly unlikely to be hit by a mag 9 earthquake. Now about today's earthquake. After any 5-6 magnitude earthquake aftershocks are normal. 2-10 aftershocks in the first 24–72 hours is common. Now it's not that there isn't any risk of earthquake anymore. There's still a chance to be hit by a big earthquake. Research says there can be maximum 7.5-8 mag earthquake in this zone. So now it's not the time to get scared. We need to be prepared for earthquake. We need to make preparation. Mark places you can take shelter during earthquakes(hard tables,beds), keep a bag ready with important papers, keep your shoes\/sandles out because there can be debris in worst case scenarios, keep a bag ready with dry food and water and Always keep faith in your god and let's pray for each other's safety.

My goal is to finish the entire exam process (all subjects) and pass the board exam within approximately 12 months.\nMy Background &amp; Constraints:\nGoal: Complete HSC in 1 year.\nPreferred Group: Science is ideal, but I am prepared to switch to Humanities or Commerce if that group offers a more realistic path for a 1-year completion.\nEducation Gap: I have a significant 4-year break since passing Class 10 (SSC\/equivalent). 2024-2025 batch from a vocational school.\nWork Schedule: This is the biggest challenge. I work a fixed night shift from 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM. I am only available for classes\/studying during the daytime\/morning.\nGroup Recommendation: Based on my time constraint, would Commerce or Humanities be a more manageable syllabus to complete in 1 year compared to Science?\n\nAlso I need some career advice as well I wanted to be a software engineer or at least a computer science background, it's my passion. But I don't think I can do it with commerce or humanities\nBut anyways thanks",

I always reach on time and receive the shift properly, even on days when I don’t even get a chance to eat. But many of my colleagues come late with excuses, and since we have no digital attendance system, entry\/exit time isn’t properly monitored. Because of that, I often end up doing extra time after my shift is already over. It’s exhausting, and I don’t know if I should “accept it as normal” or speak up — but it’s bothering me a lot.\n\nI hired someone to cook for me so I can manage my time better, but most of the time she doesn’t prepare food on time. So I often go to work without eating.\n\nMy family situation adds more weight. My father is always in debt somehow. My mother sold her own land multiple times to clear it. A few years ago I also took a bank loan to pay off his debt — but again he’s in debt. I almost carry all of my parents’ expenses, but still I don’t get the support, understanding, or stability I need from them.\n\nOn top of everything, I’m not a social person. I struggle to connect with people, so I often feel lonely and frustrated. And the environment around me doesn’t help much either.\n\nI don’t know if others feel this way, but my life constantly feels messed up. I’m trying, but some days it just becomes too much.",

        "body":"Ok, feel like I should give some context as to explain my situation first.\nI graduated from Marketing dept at a public uni back in 2017. CGPA was 3.07 on a 4.0 scale.\nAfter a while, I joined as a Marketing Researcher (part time) at a startup. \nAfter 6 months, I joined as a full time digital marketing co-ordinator, where the roles included: digital media content planning, writing, designing, social media &amp; website handling etc. Worked for a year or so, then the company shut down. \nIt was around 2021 &amp; I was unemployed again. Never really finding a good match &amp; frustrated with Covid &amp; private sector situation, I then started prepping for gov jobs. \nLong story short, there’s been around 3-4 years of gap here &amp; there, then I had to switch my path.\nI’ve been working as an assistant school teacher at a gov primary school for 3 years now.\nRecently attended IELTS, score came out 8.0.\n\nI’m 30F, unmarried. I know I’m late but I still want to settle down somewhere safer for a single woman. My budget is mid, so I’ll probably need some scholarships\/waivers.\nI would like to go to Canada\/Australia\/USA. But, I’m afraid I’d probably be rejected amidst all the crazy rigid rules. Or even if I do make it somehow, maybe I will be kicked out without a PR. \nAccording to you, which country seems like the best option right now?\nAnd I’m also really, really confused about what course &amp; career path should I go for; after going through such a chaotic track. I don’t really hate teaching as a profession, but it seems criminally under-appreciated (besides being majorly brain-rotting). I’m thinking how it’d be to do M.Ed abroad and become a teacher there (definitely not as easy as here.) \nKinda scared about reuniting with Marketing\/Business though, with the rapid growth in big data, AI, AGI &amp; such. I remember I enjoyed studying subjects like Economics, Statistics, IMC and Consumer Behaviour. What’re some  viable course options relevant to any of these that can give you sustainable leverage (demand wise) in the job market &amp; maybe help getting PR too? Help a sis out please, TYSM.",

But damn being a woman in her late 20s in a country like bangladesh feels like a curse. We are viewed as undesirable. You feel this immense pressure from your family, society to sort things out asap and get married and have bunch of kids. Because that's the only goal in a woman's life.\n\nEven if you do all of that I have seen that they are still depressed and sad most of the time. Aside from family and societal expectations, there is your own personal issues. Most of you probably haven't achieved everything you wanted to. I mean growing up you have a picture in your mind how your adult life is going to be. And when you are that adult and your life doesn't turn out how you wanted you feel like you let down your younger self. I am now older, and even more depressed. It feels like my future is dark. That my life is not going anywhere. And I will be stuck in a broken marriage where I will be forced to have children.\n\nI am sure we have our fears but why does your late 20s feel like this? I mean shouldn't we have figured out life by now? Achieved all our goals and settle. Instead I can't settle because to me settling looks like accepting defeat. That I lost to achieve my goals. And why do I always feel tired and drained. I mean even when I was in university I had to walk for 30 minutes to get to my classes and then travel 2 hours home I would still have energy to do things. Now, even weekends feel like draining. Why does it feel like everything is falling apart? Like where is the logic?",

I don’t want to isolate myself completely, but I also don’t want to get dragged into drama, competition, or fake friendships.\n\nFor those who have been through similar university environments:\nHow did you protect your peace and maintain your mental health?\nHow do you deal with ‘double-faced’ or toxic people while still surviving socially on campus?",

        "body":"I know some people will be against it but I'm still saying it anyway. My few neighbour aunts are involved in Jamaat-e-islami and hearing some of their opinions made me question about everything. Islam gave all kinds of halal rights to women but they'll be doing them covering themselves, we all know that. But what do you mean by Allah SWT said that marry only those women who can give birth. Does that mean women who are infertile will be neglected? They can't even give proper reference to this. Also women are allowed to jobs in Islam even Bibi Khadiza also did business at that time. But they'll be saying that women's job is only to serve their husbands and children and to stay at home. Don't they know the history of Islam? I bet they do but they don’t want to admit the rights of women. Also one of the aunt saw me going to school wearing uniform and then she complained to my mother saying why I don’t wear Burkha above the uniform. Duh? I'm literally going to school and I have a scarf wrapped around my head. They said how I'm seducing those street men wearing only uniform and not burkha... And whenever a 6 months old get SA'd, they complain about her clothes,like bro she's a kid,she just came to the world. Are all of them like this or It's just my surrounding? \n\nWhat do you think about it?",

Clients only like my work, not the people I hire. And most freelancers who call themselves “professional” here literally deliver trash work.

        "body":"Today a very annoying thing happened with me. So I am student of college and I carry my phone with me as I live very far and get bored on the way to college everyday and carrying a phone also allows me to contact my parents at any certain time. So for my daily commute I take public transport as it is more cheap than the college bus. So today as usual i was on my way back and had my earbuds on my ear and was listening to some song and this random person starts asking me Is my phone allowed in college and I said no it's not allowed I just carry it and obviously I don't go and wave it around my teacher's face, almost 70% of the students carry their own phone. Then he started telling me that if majority people started doing wrong things which are illegal won't be legal. And I said why do you think it's illegal, he says phone has a bad influence over people and people get easily attracted to bad things but I said that's not true. I believe it's in someone's nature, if they wanna do something wrong no amount of strictness can stop them and if someone wants to do something right no amount of bad influence can affect them. But that person kept going on and on about how it's a bad thing and I was getting pissed at this point, I said your thinking is wrong and clearly your from a small town that's why you're thinking is also small but he kept saying it's not wrong and in their times on the institution gate they used to check bags then let them enter but I said your time was different. We are not breaking any major disciplinary act, we have phone we keep it in our bag don't use it in the middle of class not disturbing anyone anyhow with my phone only use it on my way how am I doing something wrong. He's saying no I lived in Dhaka for last four years, I am in Dhaka city college, I kept telling him that you are not right and I am not obligated to answer you but he's saying I am giving a right advice to you because apparently using a earbuds wearing a uniform leaves some kind of bad mark to the name of students according to him. He wasted my time and made my ear bleed with his nonsense.\n\nHonestly I don't think phone is breaking any kind of discipline and nowadays teacher are aware that everyone has phones but they don't say anything cause somewhere they also understand some people need it as they need to contact their parents alot and by carrying it we are not doing anything wrong. Yea if someone uses it in the middle of class or exam it's wrong but if it's only kept in bag and only used outside educational institution I don't think it's bad any how and EM schools allow phones and alot of colleges started allowing phone to. Teacher coming to classes and for no reason checking bag and taking a phone should not be encouraged. And the random guy I met has very regressive thoughts and I think people like him are the reason our country is regressing and not progressing, but yea do let me know what you guys think",

What are the essentials? I'm talking styling, accessories, where to even find this stuff without breaking the bank or relying entirely on imports.\n\nSome things I'm curious about:\n\n* Layering in Indian weather (because let's be real, black in the Dhaka summer hits different)\n* Accessories that actually work - rings, chains, chokers?\n* Boots vs. regular footwear - what's practical here?\n* Thrifting vs. online vs. tailoring custom pieces?\n\nI feel like most goth fashion guides are super western-centric. Would love to hear how you all make it work in Bangladeshi context. Drop your tips, your go-to spots, your DIY hacks.",

        "title":"Dhaka English Medium Schools: Playgroup Admission Info",
        "body":"\nI have collected data on the admission costs and monthly tuition fees for PLAYGROUP at several well-known English Medium schools in Dhaka. Since the cost and fee structures for most of these schools are not publicly available, I am sharing this information to help other parents of young children.\n\nBased on the costs, these schools can be generally categorized into three tiers. Schools in the Budget-Conscious Category typically have tuition fees ranging from 8k-12k per month. These include Averroes, Playpen, Hurdco, Canadian Maple, Maple Leaf, Southbreeze, Manarat, BIT etc. You should expect to pay a one-time admission fee of between 100k and 150k during enrollment.\n\nI am calling the next category of schools Mid-Range (though sounds insane considering the cost). These schools are generally regarded as some of the best English Medium schools in Dhaka, with monthly fees between 17k and 25k. The schools in this tier are Sunbeams, Sunnydale, Glenrich (DPS STS), Sir John Wilson, Scholastica, Mastermind, International Hope, Chittagong Grammar, Singapore Kinderland etc. The initial admission costs for these schools are approximately 170k to 250k.\n\nAbove the mid-range are the more Premium Category schools. Like Springdale: Annual Tuition Fee 400K, AUSIS: Annual Tuition Fee 460K, Aga Khan: Annual Tuition Fees 650K. Admission costs of these schools are around 300k-400k.\n\nFinally, there are two God Tier international schools with fees quoted in USD: For ISD (International School Dhaka), the Admission Cost is approx. $9,000 and the Annual Tuition Fee is approx. $7,000, making the total cost for the first year around $16,000. For AISD (American International School Dhaka), the Admission Cost is $17,500 and the Annual Tuition Fees are $17,500. The total cost for the first year alone is approximately $35,000, which is close to 44 lac BDT.\n\nIt is worth noting that the one-time Admission Cost is often equal to the school's Annual Tuition Fees. Additionally, parents typically incur an additional 15% to 20% in other expenses on top of the stated tuition fees, covering costs like books, stationery, extracurricular activities etc except transportation. Transportation would cost extra 8k-10k per month.\n\nCurrently, the most competitive admission processes are found at Sunbeams, Sunnydale, and Sir John Wilson. Since the academic session starts in July for these schools, the admission process for Playgroup typically begins in August of the previous year. Child needs be within 3-4 years old on 1st July for Playgroup Admission.\n",

The entire world is calling this case a *miscarriage of justice*. The world says this case will remain an example of a farce in the name of justice. Police may apply “proportionate force’’ to protect state property and safeguard the lives and property of citizens. That is still happening—perhaps even excessively.\n\nIn Gopalganj, not a single police or army member was even slightly injured, yet during a political program there, 5–6 people were killed by the excessive force used by the current Yunus government. This is genocide.\n\nMeanwhile, from BTV, metro rail, Setu Bhaban, toll plazas to across the entire country, hundreds of businesses and vehicles were destroyed; prisons were attacked and militants–terrorists were freed. Police officers were beaten and hung. In response, actions taken in self-defense have now been turned into fabricated, baseless accusations to stage executions. Yet this makeshift “lawyer” claims no law was violated. Time will tell what was lawful and what was not.\n\nThose who are helping this illegal government and their militant allies will be punished under the existing laws of Bangladesh. That will be done through an “expedited” trial. There is nothing left to prove—everything is already proven.\n\n[Source](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share\/v\/1AHkQM7e2H\/)",

        "body":"As the title suggests, I just cannot fathom how people in their mid-40s cannot have a rational mindset about anything. Last night a lot of my family members were invited for the celebration of my parents' 25th anniversary, and due to me being an admission candidate, the talk about what I was preparing for came up. I said I am prepping for DU B and C and their face went pale as I said something so blasphemous that their comprehension cannot imagine. Their first question was. \"you read science your entire life and passed HSC with great grades; why are you going for commerce or arts? Why are you not prepping for buet?\" and in response I said that I want to stay at BD, and the current engineering market is very bad, and I don't want to study in a discipline that has so little potential here at bd. and their response was there is a huge market for engineering at BD, and then they proceeded to say the most hilarious thing i have heard in a while. They said, \"Desher CSE er to onek demand.\" I just wanted to laugh so hard. As I didn't want to argue with them, I said that \"mama, amar to eto brain nai CSE porar\" and left the living room and said to myself how unaware people are when they give any advice. When the potential of CS graduates getting a stable and good-paying job is at an all-time low in the entire world. when tech mammoths are laying off people, there are so many uncles that give this unsolicited advice. These people just cannot think for 2 minutes before spewing out uncalled advice, and the fact is they aren't illiterate or anything. They just feed into the echo chamber without realising what is happening around the world. These people make me so mad it's just insane",

Since the 16th of last month, I’ve been using terbinafine antifungal cream, but I haven’t seen any improvement. After researching on YouTube, I found out that nowadays this type of fungal infection has become quite resistant and doesn’t go away easily. I’m really frustrated with this — it itches a lot throughout the day, and even more at night.\n\nIf any of you have received treatment from a dermatologist and fully recovered, please let me know.

        "body":"There are over 9,000 public libraries and more than 125,000 librarians across the United States, all of which offer a wide variety of resources and services to the communities they serve. Similarly, Australia has a fantastic network of public libraries across all its states. Users can access an extensive catalogue of print, electronic, and multimedia resources as well as free Wi-Fi, computers, printing services, study spaces, groups, classes, and much more by joining a single library. \n\nAccording to the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, neighboring India also has an impressive library network, with approximately 1.5 million libraries, including 1.3 million school libraries—the highest single number of libraries globally. The country also hosts over 160,000 public and community libraries, with one public library for every 8,333 people, which is more than double the Asian and global averages. In Sri Lanka, according to the National Library and Document Services Board (NLDSB), there are approximately 1,500 public libraries—one for every 14,595 people. The respective local governments and urban and municipal councils govern all public libraries.\n\nCompared to India and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh has only 71 public libraries, a disproportionately low number considering the population—resulting in there being one public library for every 2,402,143 people. How embarrassing is that? \n\nI gathered the above information from The Daily Star. For all the talk and complaining we do about \"lack of civic sense\" and political and social justice, we don't pay attention to the very real cause of it all, low access to education especially in rural regions and the distinct lack of libraries in this country. Instead of protesting for delaying or cancelling exam results or forming new colleges or other ludicrous purposes we should protest to increase the availability of books across the country, not just the Capital. This will undoubtedly encourage young under-privileged men and women who want to be educated but don't have the money to enroll in a school. And, as a result will instill civic sense, duty and national responsibility in them.",

Dhaka airport can be slow, and I’m worried about delays on the domestic leg. These tickets are on separate bookings too, so if I’m late, I’m screwed.\n\nDo you think I have enough time?",

        "body":"\nShafiq Bhai probably forgot to say another success of his Govt:\ngovernment of the pressure group  by the pressure group for the pressure group\n\n\nThe Interim Government is an NGO-Gram in all but name—a gram-level outfit!! In many views, it is the weakest administration in Bangladesh’s history: so weak that even the United States would not pursue reciprocal tariff arrangements with it!!\n\nIts leaders often appear timid, unable to control the streets during a period that saw over 1,700 protests in 500 days!! They seem novice and ineffective, struggling even to pass laws, let alone enforce them!! The Interim Government has repeatedly buckled under pressure from relatively small or little-known groups!!\n\nOver the past 15 months, the IG has been bombarded with accusations of inertia and incompetence. Many dismiss it as a “do-nothing, makhon-khawa group” that stumbled into power by luck and achieved nothing and now was looking for an ignominous safe exit!!!\n\nAnd yet, when I look back, I say with confidence that this has been one of the most consequential governments of Bangladesh in many decades. It has achieved almost everything it set out to do.\n\n#Peace and stability restored. Post revolution revenge attacks brought to a halt.\n\n#The US tariff deal was secured without hiring a single lobbying firm.\n\n#A record number of laws were enacted in just 15 months, including sweeping new labour reforms.\n\n#The July Declaration established a historic new platform, and the July Charter created a political settlement that may reshape national politics for generations.\n\n#The Supreme Court asserted control over the lower judiciary, making it far more difficult for future governments to weaponize bail decisions or pursue politically motivated cases.\n\n#One of the world’s leading port operators signed the Laldia Terminal agreement, laying the foundation for a manufacturing transformation. It is the single largest European investment.\n\n#A new foreign policy framework has positioned Bangladesh at the centre of the Indo-Pacific.\n\n#The economy has been stabilised and returned to a growth trajectory.\n\n#Banking-sector plunder was curbed, the taka stabilised, and inflation contained—food inflation falling from 14 percent to seven.\n\n#According to court proceedings, accountability began to emerge for past abuses, and a long-awaited sense of justice has begun to take shape. Sheikh Hasina has been shown her place!!\n\n#Forced disappearances ceased, the BAL extremist political culture that once dominated our national life has been neutralised, and a cultural revival has followed—bolstered by widely viewed documentaries detailing earlier abuses. It is a Farooki- effect!!\n\n#The RAB now operates under the law rather than informal doctrines, and intelligence agencies have retreated from harassing dissidents. \n\n#Freedom of press and freedom of speech have been restored. Not a single staged “crossfire” incident has been reported in the last 16 months.\n\nI could go on. As an avid reader of our history, I believe no government in Bangladesh has achieved as much in such a short period as the IG has over these fifteen and a half months.\n\nFull stop.\n\n#DhakaDiary",

        "body":"Need advice\n\nSo i basically worked at this Photoshop\/photomela which I joined at first thinking I'll get to learn Microsoft office and other stuff which i did the first couple weeks from the other workers but.. after that i stopped learning stuff, i was there from 9am till isha prayer almost everyday, besides friday or if some mezban\/urush\/ biye etc type stuff was happening for almost 3 months, it became a job basically, i got paid like 50tk a day for my bus fare. The workers were nice tho ngl about that, even the owner was friendly but when it came to the money side and how long Iam \"working\" there they get pretty strict, obviously I don't like it anymore, i mean fair i learned quite a bit talking with different kind of customers and learning how to use adobe Photoshop and word etc. but.. is it really worth all that? Opening the shop at 9am and cleaning it up myself like... I don't know if im the one who's getting alot and still complaining or other way around, i only feel bad because the staff there were genuinely good people I liked hanging out with.... But that wasn't my goal at the start.. I joined in to learn.. which i stopped doing after awhile. Also another thing is.. Im one of those bekar unemployed, not studying anymore guys, that was the reason i joined this place like 3 months ago... I don't know what to do with my life, clearly this isn't it since im just wasting time here, but I don't know what else I can do...\n\nEdit: thought I should share a bit about myself. Iam 19 years old, I used to live in Oman and came back to Bangladesh at 2022 because i had visa problems, I missed my highschool exams i was basically part of the 2022 batch of SSC examinees.. which i missed and i didn't study since, been 3 years, dad went to UAE 2 Years ago and I thought he'd take me soon.. its been quite awhile im still here.. it's kinda funny but anyways.. I don't know how much longer im gonna be here but I don't want to waste it, someone bestow some wisdom on me, im really broke so IELTS is not on the table right now, im saying this because i got suggested this one multiple times. Im really broke right now, not just me, my whole family, hence why Im still here in bd instead of going to UAE because I can't buy the damn visa and some other stuff. Anyplace i can learn some work.. whatever kind of work that would benefit me later on where I might be able to make some money aswell... Again please don't say IELTS or school.. give me some proper advice older brothers and sisters of this subreddit 🙏",

I’ve been here for around three years, have a stable income, and I’m considering getting married within the next 1 year so my future spouse can join me while I’m still studying.\n\nSince I’ve been single for a long time (last relationship was in 2018–19), I’m trying to understand how realistic arranged marriage is nowadays for people in their early 20s. My parents are open to helping, but they are also unsure how the process works now since society has changed a lot.\n\nRecently I’ve seen many online discussions about modern dating, trust issues, expectations, betrayal, etc., which honestly made me a bit confused about what the normal marriage process looks like for Bangladeshis today especially for someone living abroad.\n\nFor those who went through arranged or semi-arranged marriage recently:\n\t•\tHow did the process go?\n\t•\tWhat should someone like me realistically expect? How do I do the genuine background check.\n\t•\tAny advice for someone who wants a stable, respectful, religiously aligned partner?\n\nI’m Muslim and try my best to practice, and I’m hoping to find someone who shares similar values.

But she couldn't pursue her career to take care of my older brother, who has autism.\n\nI finished my admission exam in 25. I actually got a seat at DU B unit, but as it was a low-ranking subject, I decided not to pursue it after studying for a couple of months. I chose to enroll in a Private University to get a good subject.\n\nIg my mom didn't like that. Now, like in every argument, she tells me \"Kono public e chance peye dekhate paros nai\", \"At least amra nijer ma baba ke khushi korte parsi DU te pore\", and if I correct her sentences or oppose her arguments in any other topic, she just replies with \"Tui toh DU teo tike thakte parli na\" and shii.\n\nIk that DU is tuff for this country, but Idk, now I don't even wanna study anything anymore. Her arguments are seriously getting under my skin. Today we argued and she said \"Tor toh kono bhalo bondhu o nai, amar bondhu ra at least DU te porse, tui toh gazadi der sathe ghure beras\" like tf???? She doesn't even say sorry, and if I argue too much, she decides to spit in my face and call me \"Kulangar\" and a \"Devil's spawn\".\n\nA couple of days back, I actually went to the private university I wanted to get admission in, just to check out the campus and to know a few details about the subject and the cost. My mom insisted that she come with me. I bought her along with me. I talked to the Apu at the office and got the details. BUT, when we were about to leave, my mom just stood up and told the Apu that \"Janen amar chele er ageh DU te chilo, and amio DU r student\". The girl sitting behind us just looked at me like \"Really, is this fr??\" I felt so embarrassed, I just walked out. So is anyone's mom like tis or am I just losing my mind over nothing?\n\nWhat type of Institutional pride is this?",

Why do people get into non-marital relationships like (girlfriend-boyfriend)?\n2. What is their purpose, and what do they actually do in these relationships?\n3. I see that both religious and non-religious people sometimes say they never want to get married and prefer to live independently. What does that actually mean? Don’t they have desires or physical needs?\n4. If someone wants to avoid getting into relationships , what can they do to get rid of those thoughts or the desire to try it out?",

The laptop was originally bought in 2021 and worked fine until I replaced the display in early 2024 due to scratch marks. After about a year, the new display started glitching, showing a horizontal white line and occasionally going completely black. Over time, the screen stopped displaying anything except a faint backlight. I tried updating drivers, reinstalling the OS, and even detaching the HDD, and the laptop worked briefly before a charger accidentally fell on the keyboard from about 40 cm. Since then, the display has been blank again, although the system still powers on. Multiple technicians couldn’t identify the issue, with guesses ranging from GPU to cooling problems. Battery health is also poor. Now, the laptop only shows a dim backlight with no image. I need help figuring out the real cause and whether it’s something repairable possibly a cable issue, display failure, or something else. Any guidance would be appreciated.  \n  \nPlease refer some trusted laptop repair shops in Dhaka \n\nThanks for your time",

        "body":"I have always been a quiet, calm, unnoticeable observer my entire life, but not a typical introvert.  Introvert but a different type that only understands by few. Not because I dislike people or friendships, but because my heart moves slowly. I connect deeply, not quickly. I have a small circle, and it takes me a lifetime to truly let someone in.\n\nThe last few years have been messy for me. And a few months ago, I pushed myself to step out of that shell I had lived in for so long. I tried to explore life more, talk to people more, socialize more, and allow myself to feel a little lighter.\nBut now I feel exhausted in a way that is hard to explain.\nOverwhelmed. Drained. Lost.\nLike I took ten steps forward just to end up standing in the same old place again.\n\nI don’t want to distance myself from the few people I genuinely care about, because I don’t want misunderstandings or to seem uninterested. But at the same time, I feel like I can’t handle too much anymore. My mind needs silence but my heart doesn’t want to hurt anyone. And this conflict is eating me up.\n\nI don’t think everyone would understand this sudden wave of emptiness I’m feeling — how it comes without warning, how it makes my efforts feel wasted, how it reminds me that healing is not a straight line. It’s confusing, and honestly, painful.\n\nStill, I won’t give up. I know life requires adjusting, and maybe this is just another phase I need to breathe through.\nI just wanted to share this here, without being judged or misunderstood, because writing feels like my only escape sometimes.\n\nIf any of you feel the same way, you’re not alone. You can share your thoughts too or tell me what helps you survive these phases.\nAnd whatever you’re going through, please be kind to yourself and to others. We’re all carrying things we don’t talk about.\n",

        "body":"Translated my previous post. \n\nসবার প্রতি সালাম, আমি জেমস—অবশ্যই আমার আসল নাম নয়, পরিচয় গোপন রাখার জন্য।\n\nঘটনাটি শেয়ার করার আগে কিছু প্রেক্ষাপট দিচ্ছি। আমি কয়েক বছর আগে অস্ট্রেলিয়ায় আসি। প্রথমে অন্য একটি বড় শহরে পড়াশোনা করি, তারপর ভালো সুযোগের জন্য কুইন্সল্যান্ডে চলে আসি। আল্লাহর রহমতে বিভিন্ন জব করেছি এবং ২০২২ সাল থেকে স্বাস্থ্যখাতে পড়াশোনা ও কাজ করছি—এখনও করছি।\n\nবাংলাদেশ থেকে যারা আসেন তারা জানেন, স্বাস্থ্যখাতে বাংলাদেশি দেখা কতটাই বিরল। আমার ক্লাসে বা কর্মস্থলে কখনও কোনও বাংলাদেশি পাইনি। গত ৩.৫ বছরে কুইন্সল্যান্ডে আমি মূলত ফিলিপিনো, ইন্ডিয়ান, নেপালি ও অন্যান্য জাতিগোষ্ঠীর সঙ্গে কাজ করেছি। তাদের কমিউনিটি যতটা ঐক্যবদ্ধ দেখে, সেটা আমাকে অনুপ্রাণিত করেছিল বাংলাদেশি কমিউনিটির সঙ্গে যুক্ত হতে। আমার অবশ্যই লোকাল বন্ধু আছে, কিন্তু একে তো সংস্কৃতির একটা টান থাকে, আর আমি কখনও আমার সংস্কৃতি থেকে দূরে থাকতে চাইনি। আমি সত্যিই চেয়েছিলাম এমন কিছু মানুষ পেতে যাদের সঙ্গে ভাষা, সংস্কৃতি, ব্যাকগ্রাউন্ড মিলে।\n\nএকটি গ্রুপ ছিল, যেটি কুইন্সল্যান্ডের একটি বাংলাদেশি স্টুডেন্ট অ্যাসোসিয়েশনের সাথে যুক্ত। কেউ আমাকে সেখানে অ্যাড করেছিলেন। জুলাই ২০২৪ এর প্রোটেস্টের পর গ্রুপটি বেশ সক্রিয় হয়ে উঠেছিল—মানুষ পরস্পরকে সাহায্য করছিল, কানেক্ট হচ্ছিল। কিন্তু আমি যোগ দেওয়ার কয়েক মিনিট পরেই হঠাৎ আমাকে গ্রুপ এবং চ্যাট—দুটো থেকেই ব্যান করে দেওয়া হল।\n\nগ্রুপটির অ্যাডমিন—ধরি তার নাম এন—সে আমার এক কাজিনের বন্ধু। কয়েক বছর আগে আমাদের মধ্যে ব্যক্তিগত একটি ঝামেলা হয়েছিল, যা কমিউনিটির সঙ্গে কোনও সম্পর্ক ছিল না। সে সেই পুরনো বিষয়টি ভুলতে পারেনি এবং অ্যাডমিন ক্ষমতা ব্যবহার করে ব্যক্তিগত বিরোধের কারণে আমাকে ব্যান করে দিল।\n\nশুরুতে তেমন পাত্তা দিইনি। কিন্তু কিছুদিন আগে যখন আমি রেন্টাল ভ্যাকান্সির পোস্ট দিচ্ছিলাম, তখন ঘটনা বদলে যায়। ভাগ্যক্রমে আমি এমন জায়গায় থাকি যেখানে মালিক আমাকে ঘর সাবলেট করতে বিশ্বাস করেন। এভাবে কিছু বাংলাদেশি রুম খুঁজতে এসে আমার সঙ্গে যোগাযোগ করল, এবং শেষে তিনজন বাংলাদেশি আমার বাসায় উঠল।\n\nপ্রতিদিন তাদের সাথে আমার নিজের ভাষায় কথা বলতে বলতে বুঝতে পারলাম—এতদিন আমি এই কানেকশনটা কতটা মিস করছিলাম। ৩–৪ বছর শুধু ইংরেজিতে কথা বলে এবং স্বাস্থ্যখাতে বাংলাদেশি না পেয়ে, মাতৃভাষায় স্বাভাবিক কথোপকথনই যেন মন শান্ত করে দিয়েছিল।\n\nতাদের একজনের সাথে আমি তাহসানের কনসার্টেও গিয়েছিলাম। সেখানে এক সিনিয়র ভাইয়ের সঙ্গে—ধরি তার নাম এস—দেখা হল। উনি খুব ভালোভাবে অভিবাদন জানালেন, আমি পুরো ঘটনা বললাম। উনি বললেন দেখবেন। কিছুই হয়নি, এবং সত্যি বলতে তাকে দোষ দিই না। তার পরিবার-দায়িত্ব আছে; বেশিরভাগ মানুষ এমন ক্ষুদ্র ঝামেলায় জড়াতে চান না। তাই এটাও ছেড়ে দিলাম।\n\nকিছুদিন পর কেউ একজন এন-এর বিরুদ্ধে অভিযোগ পোস্ট করল—একজনকে হুমকি দেওয়া এবং রাজনৈতিক সংযোগের ইঙ্গিত নিয়ে। তখন আরেকজন সম্মানিত কমিউনিটি লিডার—ধরি তার নাম এ—পাবলিকলি লিখলেন যে বুলিং, হয়রানি বা বৈষম্য কাউকেই ছাড় দেওয়া হবে না।\n\nআমি তাকে ব্যক্তিগতভাবে জিজ্ঞেস করলাম,\n“যদি যিনি এগুলো করছেন তিনি কমিউনিটি লিডার হন, তাহলে?”\nতিনি বললেন, ভুল তো ভুলই।\n\nতখন আমি তাকে পুরো ঘটনা খুলে বললাম—কীভাবে আমি শুধু নিজের কমিউনিটির সাথে সংযোগ করতে চেয়েছিলাম, সাহায্য করতে ও নিজেও কানেক্টেড থাকতে চেয়েছিলাম।\nভাই এ এন-এর সাথে যোগাযোগ করেন। কাজিনকেও বললাম বিষয়টি। আমি একটাই কথা স্পষ্ট করলাম—পুরনো ব্যক্তিগত ঝগড়াকে অজুহাত বানিয়ে কাউকে কমিউনিটি থেকে বাদ দেওয়া অন্যায়। অ্যাডমিন হওয়া মানে কারও উপর ব্যক্তিগত ক্ষমতা খাটানোর লাইসেন্স নয়।\n\nকাজিন এবং ভাই এ দু’জনই এন-এর সাথে কথা বলার চেষ্টা করেন, কিন্তু সে বিষয়টি এড়িয়ে যায়। শেষে সে শুধু জানায়—সে আমাকে গ্রুপে নেবে না। কোনও যুক্তি নেই, কোনও ব্যাখ্যা নেই—শুধু জেদ।\n\nঅনেকে সহজেই বুঝতে পারবেন আমি কার কথা বলছি, কারণ এর আগেও তাকে বাংলাদেশের একটি রাজনৈতিক দলের সাথে জড়িত বলে অভিযোগ উঠেছিল। মজার বিষয়, সে নিজেই বলেছিল সে দলের নয়, কারণ সে নাকি তাদের বিরুদ্ধে “প্রোটেস্ট করেছিল”—কিন্তু তার আচরণ ঠিক সেই গত দশকের দেশের রাজনৈতিক চরিত্রগুলোর মতো।\n\nসে এমনকি আমার কাজিনকে বলেছে কিছু নির্দিষ্ট আত্মীয়কে নাকি অভিযোগ করবে এবং “অ্যাকশন নেবে”—মানে পরিস্থিতি বাড়াতে চাইছিল, অথচ আমার উদ্দেশ্য ছিল শুধু ন্যায্যতা। আমি কাজিনকে বললাম—মানুষ জানুক বা না জানুক, আমার আপত্তি নেই; আমি শুধু চাই অন্যরা জানুক কীভাবে কিছু লোক ভদ্রতার মুখোশ পরে ব্যক্তিগত শত্রুতার বদলা নেয়।\n\nদীর্ঘদিন ধরেই তার আচরণ নিয়ে বিভিন্ন মানুষের কাছ থেকে গুজব ও অভিযোগ শুনেছি—যেগুলো আমি বলব না, কারণ তার মতো পেছনে লাগা বা অপবাদ দেওয়া আমার উদ্দেশ্য নয়।\n\nযা আমাকে সবচেয়ে বিস্মিত করেছে—সে আমাকে ব্যান করলেও, স্বাস্থ্যখাত সম্পর্কিত কোনও তথ্য জানতে কেউ তাকে জিজ্ঞেস করলে সে আমার নম্বর তাদের কাছে দিয়ে দিত।\nকারণ “এন ভাইয়া আপনার নম্বর দিছে”—এই কথাই শোনা যেত।\nমানে, তার নিজের প্রয়োজনে আমি ভালো, কিন্তু কমিউনিটিতে আমার থাকা সে মেনে নিতে পারে না।\n\nআমি প্রচুর জাতিগোষ্ঠীর মানুষের সাথে কাজ করেছি—অস্ট্রেলিয়ান, পাঞ্জাবি, ফিলিপিনো, নেপালি, সাউথ ইন্ডিয়ান—কিন্তু এমন নোংরা গেটকিপিং আর কোথাও দেখিনি। যাদের কাছে গিয়েছিলাম তারা চেষ্টা করেছেন—সেটা আমি সম্মান করি—কিন্তু বেশি কিছু করার ছিল না।\n\nতাই হ্যাঁ—এমন সাপে ভরা মানুষের ব্যাপারে সতর্ক থাকুন। তারা বাইরে থেকে হাসিমুখে সাহায্যকারী সাজে, ছোট্ট কোনও উপকার করলে দশজনকে বলে বেড়ায়, অথচ আড়ালে ক্ষমতার অপব্যবহার করে। যে সত্যিকারের সাহায্য করে, সে চুপচাপ করে; সে ক্ষমতা দেখিয়ে মানুষকে অপমান করে না।\n\nআমার ব্যক্তিগত ভাবে তেমন কষ্ট নেই। আমার কাজ ও পড়াশোনা ভালোই চলছে, আল্লাহর রহমতে সব ঠিক আছে। দুঃখ শুধু এই—বিদেশের মাটিতে নিজের কমিউনিটির সাথে কানেক্ট হতে চেয়ে, সংস্কৃতির টান বজায় রাখতে চেয়ে, কেউ একজনের ছোট মনের কারণে এমনভাবে দূরে সরিয়ে দেওয়া হয়।\n\nসত্যিকারের সদাচরণ নীরব।\nসত্যিকারের নেতৃত্ব ব্যক্তিগত আবেগ নয়, কমিউনিটির স্বার্থ দেখে।\n\nএমন ভণ্ড, ছদ্মবেশী মানুষ থেকে সাবধান থাকুন। নিজের পরিচিতজনদেরও সচেতন করুন।\n\nআর যদি আপনারা জানেন কীভাবে এমন মানুষদের ব্যাপারে আরও বেশি মানুষকে সচেতন করা যায়, তাহলে আমাকে জানান।”",

Later the next day was off day and I was suppose to join from today (15th of Nov). So i was told to be present there at 10 am. After that, the receptionist told me to wait for the HR and I waited for like 2 goddamn hours. Then they told me to go the cabin where HR and the manager were present. They let me sit and told me that we aren’t continuing with you because of the post you made (are you fucking kidding me!?) I simply said that it was my right to know about your company since your digital presence isn’t visible enough. Then she dared to threat me saying that, 'eshob khetre amra police case kore thaki, apni fresher dekhe kichu korini' duh. Tarpor the manager started giving me lecture but i left the room right away. They were kept saying that miss we arent finished yet PLEASE kotha shunun Like DUH you've wasted  my 2 fucking hours now you want me to listen your lecture???? Mind you they didn’t even bother to let me know beforehand.  \n\nPS after living the office i went to a park and cried like a baby thinking of this humiliation. \n \nPS I made the post anonymously.

The app shows the live position of running trains so you can locate your train easily. My goal is to make train tracking simple and helpful for everyone.\n\nYou can try the testing version by following these steps:\n\n**Step 1:** Join the tester Google Group [(link here)](https:\/\/groups.google.com\/g\/mytraintrackerbd) \\[ [https:\/\/groups.google.com\/g\/mytraintrackerbd](https:\/\/groups.google.com\/g\/mytraintrackerbd) \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Install the app from the Play Store [(Playstore)](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app) \\[ [https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app) \\]\n\nNote: Without step 1, step 2 won't work. If the app does not appear, please make sure you are using the same Google account for both steps.\n\nAfter trying it, if you notice any issue in loading, tracking, or timing, please share your feedback in the comments.\n\nHope this makes Bangladesh Railway travel way less stressful for everyone!",

I can stretch my personal expenses a bit, so I’m willing to take calculated risks just nothing extreme.\n\nA bit about my background so you can suggest better:\n\n* I’ve worked **2+ years as a Business Development Manager** (client acquisition + client management + scaling accounts) Before that I worked as a Freelancer on Upwork since 2021 and had Top Rated badges on there.\n* Experience in **telemarketing**, **WordPress web design**, **affiliate marketing**, **social media marketing**, and **client hunting**\n* Previously collaborated with **international call centers**, providing them with projects and helping them operate\n* Overall, I have a good understanding of **digital money-making models**, but I’m now looking for something more strategic or higher-ticket\n\nWhat I’m hoping for:  \nA **realistic roadmap**, investment ideas, or business models where my experience fits and where 2 lakhs can be enough to get started. Sometimes one suggestion from someone else’s experience can open a whole new direction so I’d really appreciate your input.\n\nIf you’ve built something similar before or know someone who has, please share what worked for you.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "title":"Should I Do a Master’s\/PhD Abroad? Average Student, No Passion, Married, and Scared to Go Alone",
        "body":"\nHi everyone,\nI’m really confused about my future and need honest, experience-based advice from people who’ve studied abroad.\n\nA bit about me:\n\t\n•\tI’ve always been an average-but-capable student. I’m not the type who studies out of curiosity or passion, but if something needs to be done, I do it properly.\n\t\n•\tMy parents pushed me to study my whole life, so academics became a routine, not a passion.\n\t\n•\tI got into a top engineering university in Bangladesh and kept a CGPA above 3.5, mostly by studying hard during finals and class tests.\n\t\n•\tI did my undergrad thesis seriously and completed it well, but I don’t have the drive to turn it into a publication now.\n\nHere’s the key thing about me:\nIf I have to study something — even something I don’t enjoy — I will sit down, push through, and complete it properly.\nDifficult course? I’ll grind through it.\nBoring topic? I’ll still learn enough to get a good result.\nI’m disciplined when required, just… not naturally passionate.\n\nBut I’m also someone with no specific research interest. No favorite field. No topic I feel excited about. I don’t enjoy reading research papers. I don’t have that “curiosity spark” people talk about in academia.\n\nAnother important piece:\n\nStudying has always been my comfort zone because that’s all I’ve ever done. I didn’t participate in extracurriculars, clubs, or competitions. My entire life has basically been “study and survive.” So whenever I’m lost, my mind automatically goes back to, “Maybe I should study more.”\n\nRight now I’m genuinely stuck:\n\n•\tI’m not applying to private jobs.\n\n•\tI’m not studying for government jobs (and        honestly, those don’t attract me at all).\n\n•\tI’m just drifting without direction.\n\nEmotionally, things are complicated:\n\n•\tLiving away from home in undergrad was difficult.\n\n•\tEverything became easier after I married my long-term partner because he was there with me.\n\n•\tI also had close friends who studied with me, discussed everything, and kept me motivated.\n\nIf I study abroad, I’ll be alone — no husband, no built-in support system, no study group.\nAnd since I’m already unsure about academics, the idea of managing studies + loneliness feels terrifying.\n\nSo I want honest answers from people who’ve actually lived this:\n\n1.\tHow hard is a Master’s or PhD abroad for someone like me — disciplined enough to get work done, but not passionate?\n\n2.\tIs it risky to start a research degree when you don’t have a specific research interest?\n\n3.\tDo people find passion later, or is that just a comforting myth?\n\n4.\tHow emotionally tough is life abroad when you’re married but going alone?\n\n5.\tCan someone like me actually handle the pressure, or is this setting myself up for burnout?\n\n6.\tShould I work for a while in Bangladesh to understand myself before deciding?\n\nMy thoughts are all over the place, and I’m really lost. Any honest advice would mean a lot.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

        "body":"My wife — along with her mother and sister — is often very mean and rude to others. Her mother used to hit the household help, and my wife grew up seeing that. She knows that I dislike such behavior, but she continues doing things that are hurtful. She doesn’t get along with anyone: not with my mother, not with her own mother, and not with any helping hand. She behaves as though everything must go exactly her way, immediately, without consideration for others.\n\nRecently we hired a helping hand to take care of our daughter, and my wife made her life extremely difficult. She treated her very harshly, almost like she wasn’t a human being. She used very hurtful language toward her—for example saying things like *“Khodar khasir moto khacche bose bose”*. The truth is, the girl didn’t even eat much, and even if she did, I don’t understand why it would be a problem. I believe that rizq is from Allah, and by His grace and mercy I can afford the household expenses. I have repeatedly asked my wife not to behave like this, and especially not to make comments about someone’s rizq. It is her provision from Allah; we have no right to question it. But my wife didn’t care.\n\nIn the end, to protect the helping hand from more mistreatment, I convinced my wife by saying that the girl was not doing anything important, and maybe we should send her home. My wife agreed, and we sent her back. When she was leaving, the girl was crying — and it really broke my heart. I feel terrible, and sometimes I cry privately in the bathroom so my wife doesn’t see it. I don’t know what to do. Is this normal? Do most families treat their helping hands this way? When I was growing up, we never had household help. We weren’t financially well off back then, and my mother did everything by herself.",

He is worried now because he heard from somewhere that a student can only attend HSC 3 times. He cannot ask the college authorities because they treat them harshly and he is ashamed to face his professors and juniors. So can anyone inform me if its possible to attend HSC for the 4th time? It would be really helpful for him if someone could answer this question",
