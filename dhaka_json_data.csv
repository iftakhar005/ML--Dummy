Phone Stolen at Airport Railway Station,"Hi everyone,  
Yesterday, my phone (Google Pixel 7 Pro) was stolen from my pocket while I was getting into the train at Airport Railway Station. I filed a GD at Airport Railway Station Thana, but I’m not sure what else I can do now to try to recover it.

My biggest concern is unauthorized access to my personal data. I’ve already taken the following steps today:

* Reissued my SIM
* Signed out of all Google accounts
* Logged out of apps like WhatsApp and other services
* Locked the device from my Google account

Still, I’m worried if there’s anything more I should do to protect my data or increase the chance of getting the phone back.

If anyone has experience with similar cases or knows the proper steps to take in Dhaka, I would really appreciate your guidance.  
Specifically:

* Any realistic ways to track or recover a stolen phone here?
* Whether contacting the mobile operator or Google support helps in any way
* How to effectively follow up with the thana to improve recovery chances
* Any additional precautions to secure my data

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

  
I also used GPT to refine this post so that I can clearly explain my situation.\*",Clear-Stop-1087,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1p3yjfj/phone_stolen_at_airport_railway_station/,2025-11-22 23:12:20,Dhaka
Earthquake and fear mongering by News outlets,"After the earthquakes that hit Bangladesh in the last 2 days News outlets have started over exaggerating the threat. They are capitalizing on people's fear. I saw one outlet literally saying there can be magnitude 9 earthquakes in Bangladesh. First of all this is total vogus. Bangladesh does not have the type of subduction zone needed for magnitude 9 earthquakes. So it is highly unlikely to be hit by a mag 9 earthquake. Now about today's earthquake. After any 5-6 magnitude earthquake aftershocks are normal. 2-10 aftershocks in the first 24–72 hours is common. Now it's not that there isn't any risk of earthquake anymore. There's still a chance to be hit by a big earthquake. Research says there can be maximum 7.5-8 mag earthquake in this zone. So now it's not the time to get scared. We need to be prepared for earthquake. We need to make preparation. Mark places you can take shelter during earthquakes(hard tables,beds), keep a bag ready with important papers, keep your shoes/sandles out because there can be debris in worst case scenarios, keep a bag ready with dry food and water and Always keep faith in your god and let's pray for each other's safety.

"Urgent Help: Best Path to Complete HSC in 1 Year as a Private Candidate in Dhaka (4-Year Gap, Night Job 9 PM-6 AM)","Hello everyone,
I need serious advice on the quickest and most flexible way to obtain my Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC). My goal is to finish the entire exam process (all subjects) and pass the board exam within approximately 12 months.
My Background &amp; Constraints:
Goal: Complete HSC in 1 year.
Preferred Group: Science is ideal, but I am prepared to switch to Humanities or Commerce if that group offers a more realistic path for a 1-year completion.
Education Gap: I have a significant 4-year break since passing Class 10 (SSC/equivalent). 2024-2025 batch from a vocational school.
Work Schedule: This is the biggest challenge. I work a fixed night shift from 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM. I am only available for classes/studying during the daytime/morning.
Group Recommendation: Based on my time constraint, would Commerce or Humanities be a more manageable syllabus to complete in 1 year compared to Science?

Also I need some career advice as well I wanted to be a software engineer or at least a computer science background, it's my passion. But I don't think I can do it with commerce or humanities

Physics said:  
“Brother, today you walk.”

I literally get ejected like a poorly installed USB drive.

**Did not look back.**  
**Did not even slow down.**

He just kept going…  
like I was never part of the subscription plan.  
Like I was a *free trial* that expired mid-pothole.

He left with the bike.  
I was left with…  
**the helmet.**  
Just standing there on the road holding it like a freshly divorced husband holding the blender she didn’t take.

People were staring.

I said, “Bhai, amio jani na… amar shathe breakup kore chole gelo.”

Feeling Burnt Out From All Sides,"I don’t usually share personal things, but I’m at a point where everything feels heavy and I need to let it out.

I work full-time with shifting duty. I always reach on time and receive the shift properly, even on days when I don’t even get a chance to eat. But many of my colleagues come late with excuses, and since we have no digital attendance system, entry/exit time isn’t properly monitored. Because of that, I often end up doing extra time after my shift is already over. It’s exhausting, and I don’t know if I should “accept it as normal” or speak up — but it’s bothering me a lot.

I hired someone to cook for me so I can manage my time better, but most of the time she doesn’t prepare food on time. So I often go to work without eating.

My family situation adds more weight. My father is always in debt somehow. My mother sold her own land multiple times to clear it. A few years ago I also took a bank loan to pay off his debt — but again he’s in debt. I almost carry all of my parents’ expenses, but still I don’t get the support, understanding, or stability I need from them.

On top of everything, I’m not a social person. I struggle to connect with people, so I often feel lonely and frustrated. And the environment around me doesn’t help much either.

I don’t know if others feel this way, but my life constantly feels messed up. I’m trying, but some days it just becomes too much.",Altruistic-Drama447,15,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1p3jojm/feeling_burnt_out_from_all_sides/,2025-11-22 10:05:30,Dhaka

Trying to learn business but damn… it’s harder than I thought,"So I’ve been trying to learn business lately e-commerce, trading, investments, all that. And honestly man, I didn’t expect it to feel this confusing. Everyone online makes it look so simple: “start a store,” “learn marketing,” “just be consistent,” but when you’re actually sitting down trying to understand everything step by step… it hits different.

I’m 21, trying to figure out my life, trying to build something real. But every time I start learning, I feel overwhelmed. Too many paths, too much information, and no one to guide me in real life. I feel like I’m fighting my own thoughts half the time, like I want to improve, I want to build a business, but I don’t even know where to start anymore.

If anyone else struggled like this in the beginning, how did you push through? How did you stay focused and actually understand things instead of just getting lost in information?

How to control myself,"Okay so due to some personal reasons, I hold resentment and grudges against my parents. I don't like it at all how they don't let me have privacy and barge in whenever they want and tell me to do stuffs. It's like their regular thing to disturb me. Now since I can't control myself when I get annoyed I tend to raise my voice a lot or shout at them. And I behave very rudely when they barge in when I'm studying. My focus tends to get ruined at the smallest of sounds so it's so so hard for me to get my focus back when they barge in and talk to me and thus I get angry and my first tendency is to shout. I can't help it since I struggle a lot to get my focus back once it's Lost. Now the thing is I think is might be one of the major reasons Allah isn't accepting my duas. I want to control this reaction of mine no matter how much struggle or anger it brings. Any suggestions how to stop this response?

What country &amp; Master’s course to apply for?,"Ok, feel like I should give some context as to explain my situation first.
I graduated from Marketing dept at a public uni back in 2017. CGPA was 3.07 on a 4.0 scale.
After a while, I joined as a Marketing Researcher (part time) at a startup. 
After 6 months, I joined as a full time digital marketing co-ordinator, where the roles included: digital media content planning, writing, designing, social media &amp; website handling etc. Worked for a year or so, then the company shut down. 
It was around 2021 &amp; I was unemployed again. Never really finding a good match &amp; frustrated with Covid &amp; private sector situation, I then started prepping for gov jobs. 
Long story short, there’s been around 3-4 years of gap here &amp; there, then I had to switch my path.
I’ve been working as an assistant school teacher at a gov primary school for 3 years now.
Recently attended IELTS, score came out 8.0.

I’m 30F, unmarried. I know I’m late but I still want to settle down somewhere safer for a single woman. My budget is mid, so I’ll probably need some scholarships/waivers.
I would like to go to Canada/Australia/USA. But, I’m afraid I’d probably be rejected amidst all the crazy rigid rules. Or even if I do make it somehow, maybe I will be kicked out without a PR. 
According to you, which country seems like the best option right now?
And I’m also really, really confused about what course &amp; career path should I go for; after going through such a chaotic track. I don’t really hate teaching as a profession, but it seems criminally under-appreciated (besides being majorly brain-rotting). I’m thinking how it’d be to do M.Ed abroad and become a teacher there (definitely not as easy as here.) 
Kinda scared about reuniting with Marketing/Business though, with the rapid growth in big data, AI, AGI &amp; such. I remember I enjoyed studying subjects like Economics, Statistics, IMC and Consumer Behaviour. What’re some  viable course options relevant to any of these that can give you sustainable leverage (demand wise) in the job market &amp; maybe help getting PR too?

But i cannot logic my way out of MD. the sole reason I went there was bc i know what is wrong with me and i needed direction. If you look up MD, it is a literal addiction, similar to drugs.

ছোটবেলা থেকেই তথাকথিত ভালো স্টুডেন্ট,, এসএসসি পর্যন্ত একাডেমিক রেজাল্ট মোটামুটি ভালোই, ইভেন জেএসসি এসএসসি তে নিজের জেলাতে প্লেস ও করেছি। তবে আমার ধ্বংসের শুরু হয় hsc লাইফে,, বাসা থেকে দূরের কলেজে পড়তে যায়, প্রথম দিকে মোটামুটি ভালোই পড়াশোনা করতাম। তবে হঠাৎ কেমন যেনো পড়াশোনা থেকে দূরে সরে যেতে থাকি,হোস্টেলের সিনিয়র জুনিয়র দের সাথে আড্ডা, ফোনে অ্যাডিকশন, অতিরিক্ত ঘুম সব মিলিয়ে সব কেমন যেন হয়ে গেছিলো। ফলস্বরূপ hsc টেস্ট এক্সামে 1sub এ ফেইল করি😅। বাসায় মাকে জানাই। মা নিজেই বাবাকে কিছু জানাতে নিষেধ করে hsc এর জন্য ভালো করে প্রিপারেশন নিতে বলে, হয়তো মায়ের বিশ্বাস ছিল পারবো আমি।
সেইভাবে শুরু করি প্রিপারেশন, এক্সাম এর আগে মোটামুটি একটা প্রিপারেশন হয়েই যায়। এক্সাম শুরু হলো, মোটামুটি ভালোই চলছিল। এর মাঝে শুরু হয় কোটা আন্দোলন (ও হ্যাঁ বলা হয়নি আমার hsc 24 এ)।  পরে তো নানা আন্দোলন অনেক কিছুতে পড়া হয়নি। শেষ পর্যন্ত সবগুলো এক্সাম ও হয় নি। যেইগুলো হয়েছে তাতে মোটামুটি ভালো রেজাল্ট করি কারণ এসএসসি তে রেজাল্ট ভালো ছিল। Then শুরু করি মেডিকেলের প্রেপ নেওয়া। পারিপার্শ্বিক কারণ, নিজের খামখেয়ালী, এক্সাম হল এ নার্ভাসনেস নানা কারণে খুব অল্পের জন্য চান্স হয়নি। তারপর ঠিক করি 2nd টাইম আবার দিব। কিন্তু বাড়ি থেকে বলে কয়েকটা ভার্সিটি তে পরীক্ষা দিতে, কয়েকটা তে দেই, ওয়েটিং লিস্টে নাম আসে, কৃষি তে চান্স ও পাই, কিন্তু মাথায় তখন ভূত আমি 2nd টাইম দিব, বাড়িতে রাজি করাই যে ভর্তি হব না কৃষি তে। রাজি হয়, কিন্তু বন্ধুদের বেশিরভাগ ই চান্স পেয়ে যায়, এইসব দেখেই নাকি জানি না আমার মনে হতো আমার মা বাবা হয়তো আমাকে উপর উপর সাপোর্ট করছে, সবাই আমার উপর অখুশি। নিজেকে নিজে বুঝ দিতাম এমন টা না। তবে তাদের কিছু আচরণ এর কারণে প্রায়ই এমন মনে হতো। 2nd টাইম প্রিপারেশন শুরু করলাম, কিন্তু ওই যে আমার মনে হওয়া আমাকে শান্তি দিত না। পড়তে বসলে কি যেনো ভাবতাম, তারপর আস্তে আস্তে কখন পড়াশোনা থেকে আবার সরে যাচ্ছিলাম আমি বুঝতেই পারি নি। যখন বুঝছি তখন অনেক দেরি হয়ে গেছে, আর মাত্র ২০ দিন পরে মেডিকেল এক্সাম কিন্তু আমি যেনো কিছুই পারি না। লাস্ট কিছুদিন ধরে মায়ের কথা শোনানোর দিক টাও যেনো বেড়ে গেছে মনে হচ্ছে। বাবা একদিন ডেকে বলছে এইবার আর আমাকে কষ্ট দিও না। এইসব শোনার পর থেকে আমি আর নিজের মধ্যে নেই, দিন রাত সবাইকে লুকিয়ে খালি কান্না করছি, কাউকে কিছু share করতে পারছি না। কি করবো কিচ্ছু বুঝছি না। নিজেকে খুব অসহায় লাগছে। খালি মনে হচ্ছে সব শেষ করে ফেলছি নিজের হাতে, এখন আর করার কিছুই নেই। আর কিছু নিতে পারছি না। শুধু মনে হচ্ছে মেডিকেল এর রেজাল্ট যখন হবে যদি চান্স না পাই আমি সবার সামনে কিভাবে যাবো, কিভাবে মা বাবা কে ফেস করব। এর থেকে ভাল নিজেই নিজেকে শেষ করে দেই। এইসব উল্টাপাল্টা ভেবেই চলেছি। কিন্তু কাজ এর কাজ কিছুই হচ্ছে না। 

এইসব এইখানে লিখতাম না, share করার মতো কাউকে পাচ্ছি না। নিজেও সহ্য করতে পারছি না আর তাই বাধ্য হয়ে লিখছি। নিজেকে শেষ করার মতো সাহস আমার নেই, আবার রেজাল্ট পরবর্তী দিনগুলোর কথা ভেবে মনে হচ্ছে ওইসব আমি সহ্য করতে পারবো না। কি করবো কিচ্ছু বুঝছি না। 

বি.দ্রঃ প্লীজ কেউ বাজে কমেন্ট করবেন না, যদি পোস্ট টা পড়ে বাজে কিছু বলার হয় মনে মনে বলে পোস্ট টা এড়িয়ে যাবেন, ধন্যবাদ🙂।

Ages from 24-30 is one of the hardest stages of life,"I am 27 (f) now. I feel like I am in a sinking ship. I don't know how it is about guys. I am sure men go through their own problems. But damn being a woman in her late 20s in a country like bangladesh feels like a curse. We are viewed as undesirable. You feel this immense pressure from your family, society to sort things out asap and get married and have bunch of kids. Because that's the only goal in a woman's life.

Even if you do all of that I have seen that they are still depressed and sad most of the time. Aside from family and societal expectations, there is your own personal issues. Most of you probably haven't achieved everything you wanted to. I mean growing up you have a picture in your mind how your adult life is going to be. And when you are that adult and your life doesn't turn out how you wanted you feel like you let down your younger self. I am now older, and even more depressed. It feels like my future is dark. That my life is not going anywhere. And I will be stuck in a broken marriage where I will be forced to have children.

I am sure we have our fears but why does your late 20s feel like this? I mean shouldn't we have figured out life by now? Achieved all our goals and settle. Instead I can't settle because to me settling looks like accepting defeat. That I lost to achieve my goals. And why do I always feel tired and drained. I mean even when I was in university I had to walk for 30 minutes to get to my classes and then travel 2 hours home I would still have energy to do things. Now, even weekends feel like draining. Why does it feel like everything is falling apart?

How do you maintain mental health in a private university environment where people feel double-faced and toxic?,"I study in a private university and lately it’s been mentally exhausting. Many people here act very double-faced—pretending to be friendly on the surface but being toxic, judgmental, or fake behind the scenes. What confuses me even more is that they all somehow stay together in groups, even though they clearly don’t like each other.

I’m trying to focus on myself, my studies, and my growth, but the environment sometimes gets heavy. I don’t want to isolate myself completely, but I also don’t want to get dragged into drama, competition, or fake friendships.

For those who have been through similar university environments:

Does feminism exist in Jamaat?,"I know some people will be against it but I'm still saying it anyway. My few neighbour aunts are involved in Jamaat-e-islami and hearing some of their opinions made me question about everything. Islam gave all kinds of halal rights to women but they'll be doing them covering themselves, we all know that. But what do you mean by Allah SWT said that marry only those women who can give birth. Does that mean women who are infertile will be neglected? They can't even give proper reference to this. Also women are allowed to jobs in Islam even Bibi Khadiza also did business at that time. But they'll be saying that women's job is only to serve their husbands and children and to stay at home. Don't they know the history of Islam? I bet they do but they don’t want to admit the rights of women. Also one of the aunt saw me going to school wearing uniform and then she complained to my mother saying why I don’t wear Burkha above the uniform. Duh? I'm literally going to school and I have a scarf wrapped around my head. They said how I'm seducing those street men wearing only uniform and not burkha... And whenever a 6 months old get SA'd, they complain about her clothes,like bro she's a kid,she just came to the world. Are all of them like this or It's just my surrounding?

Do you consider carrying phone as a student illegal?,"Today a very annoying thing happened with me. So I am student of college and I carry my phone with me as I live very far and get bored on the way to college everyday and carrying a phone also allows me to contact my parents at any certain time. So for my daily commute I take public transport as it is more cheap than the college bus. So today as usual i was on my way back and had my earbuds on my ear and was listening to some song and this random person starts asking me Is my phone allowed in college and I said no it's not allowed I just carry it and obviously I don't go and wave it around my teacher's face, almost 70% of the students carry their own phone. Then he started telling me that if majority people started doing wrong things which are illegal won't be legal. And I said why do you think it's illegal, he says phone has a bad influence over people and people get easily attracted to bad things but I said that's not true. I believe it's in someone's nature, if they wanna do something wrong no amount of strictness can stop them and if someone wants to do something right no amount of bad influence can affect them. But that person kept going on and on about how it's a bad thing and I was getting pissed at this point, I said your thinking is wrong and clearly your from a small town that's why you're thinking is also small but he kept saying it's not wrong and in their times on the institution gate they used to check bags then let them enter but I said your time was different. We are not breaking any major disciplinary act, we have phone we keep it in our bag don't use it in the middle of class not disturbing anyone anyhow with my phone only use it on my way how am I doing something wrong. He's saying no I lived in Dhaka for last four years, I am in Dhaka city college, I kept telling him that you are not right and I am not obligated to answer you but he's saying I am giving a right advice to you because apparently using a earbuds wearing a uniform leaves some kind of bad mark to the name of students according to him. He wasted my time and made my ear bleed with his nonsense.

Honestly I don't think phone is breaking any kind of discipline and nowadays teacher are aware that everyone has phones but they don't say anything cause somewhere they also understand some people need it as they need to contact their parents alot and by carrying it we are not doing anything wrong. Yea if someone uses it in the middle of class or exam it's wrong but if it's only kept in bag and only used outside educational institution I don't think it's bad any how and EM schools allow phones and alot of colleges started allowing phone to. Teacher coming to classes and for no reason checking bag and taking a phone should not be encouraged. And the random guy I met has very regressive thoughts and I think people like him are the reason our country is regressing and not progressing, but yea do let me know what you guys think",SE9A,7,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1p1wm26/do_you_consider_carrying_phone_as_a_student/,2025-11-20 13:02:09,Dhaka
I (Male 18) am looking for bengali friends so I can keep learning the language,"Im Argentinian and Ive been trying to learn Bangla for about 4 months now, Ive already learned the basics of the script (Such as the Consonants and Vowels) and Ive been trying to find people to talk to, so I can pick up those little things of the language that one cant really learn, and to practice my pronunciations, to put the language at use, etcetera my Instagram is Enzzzo5, Ill talk a bit about myself next so you can know what I enjoy 

Im 18 years old, my birthday is February 6, I am very very into music, and nearly all the time im listening to it or to informative videos, I myself play guitar and the piano (To a very basic level) and I enjoy to create and find new music from every language, as of now, I havent found much bengali music, but im very very open, I love Lagnajita Chakraborty, shes an awesome singer, I love many music genres, Rock, Metal, Jazz, classical music, soul music, pop, Synth wave, Experimental music and etcetera, whatever is music, I can enjoy it.

I love animals and Wild-life, I have a soft spot for non-loved animals, such as spiders, tarantulas, scorpions and centipedes, And I have hours upon hours of information to talk about animals, music and more

I like to play video games and talk about them, although my computer broke very recently

I like drawing, studying, and anime a lot, my favorite anime is Tokyo Ghoul, which I can also talk about for hours, I have lots of passion for the shows and animes that I love, of course, I love it when people talk to me about shows and things that they like, so I can be a good listener if you appreciate that

Lastly - because I know the culture and country can be quite conservative (Which I respect) I should mention that I am not, I only mention this so somebody wont come to me with the idea of me being conservative and then feeling betrayed or something when I respectfully disagree.

Dhaka English Medium Schools: Playgroup Admission Info,"
I have collected data on the admission costs and monthly tuition fees for PLAYGROUP at several well-known English Medium schools in Dhaka. Since the cost and fee structures for most of these schools are not publicly available, I am sharing this information to help other parents of young children.

Based on the costs, these schools can be generally categorized into three tiers. Schools in the Budget-Conscious Category typically have tuition fees ranging from 8k-12k per month. These include Averroes, Playpen, Hurdco, Canadian Maple, Maple Leaf, Southbreeze, Manarat, BIT etc. You should expect to pay a one-time admission fee of between 100k and 150k during enrollment.

I am calling the next category of schools Mid-Range (though sounds insane considering the cost). These schools are generally regarded as some of the best English Medium schools in Dhaka, with monthly fees between 17k and 25k. The schools in this tier are Sunbeams, Sunnydale, Glenrich (DPS STS), Sir John Wilson, Scholastica, Mastermind, International Hope, Chittagong Grammar, Singapore Kinderland etc. The initial admission costs for these schools are approximately 170k to 250k.

Above the mid-range are the more Premium Category schools. Like Springdale: Annual Tuition Fee 400K, AUSIS: Annual Tuition Fee 460K, Aga Khan: Annual Tuition Fees 650K. Admission costs of these schools are around 300k-400k.

Finally, there are two God Tier international schools with fees quoted in USD: For ISD (International School Dhaka), the Admission Cost is approx. $9,000 and the Annual Tuition Fee is approx. $7,000, making the total cost for the first year around $16,000. For AISD (American International School Dhaka), the Admission Cost is $17,500 and the Annual Tuition Fees are $17,500. The total cost for the first year alone is approximately $35,000, which is close to 44 lac BDT.

It is worth noting that the one-time Admission Cost is often equal to the school's Annual Tuition Fees. Additionally, parents typically incur an additional 15% to 20% in other expenses on top of the stated tuition fees, covering costs like books, stationery, extracurricular activities etc except transportation. Transportation would cost extra 8k-10k per month.

Currently, the most competitive admission processes are found at Sunbeams, Sunnydale, and Sir John Wilson. Since the academic session starts in July for these schools, the admission process for Playgroup typically begins in August of the previous year. Child needs be within 3-4 years old on 1st July for Playgroup Admission.

BRAC University’s Architecture requirements feel kinda unusual,"I passed SSC in Science and HSC in Commerce. Today I applied for the Architecture undergrad program at brac university, and I noticed something weird, every other department lists specific subject requirements like physics or biology, but Architecture doesn’t ask for any particular background. It’s just like BBA in that sense, except Architecture has a separate drawing exam.

I got confused, so I called BRAC’s call center. They said I can apply from commerce. I also emailed them, and they confirmed the same thing. But I’m still lowkey unsure because almost every other university in Bangladesh requires physics or at least some science subjects for architecture.

Can anyone confirm why BRAC is different here? Like what’s their logic behind not requiring science subjects?

Explain this Bangladeshi Economy and Market related question to a less educated person.,"We all must admit that we Bangladeshi people don't like sudden price hikes of daily goods. But, the economy of Bangladesh is Mixed Economy. So, on the goods where market rated price (MRP) is not mentioned, can fluctuate on the basis of supply and demand. 

It is all the vendor's choice to determine the price, doesn't matter if its unaffordable for the people. Higher price, lower demands, the price goes down automatically. So why people complains about it?

ক্রস এক্সামিন;

হাসি-তামশা বাদ রেখে দেখি কেমন 'উকিল' দাঁড় করানো হয়েছে প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার মামলায়। সমগ্র বিশ্ব এই মামলাকে বলছে 'মিসকারেজ অব জাস্টিস'। বিশ্ব বলছে, বিচারের নামে প্রহসনের দৃষ্টান্ত হয়ে থাকবে এই মামলা। পুলিশ রাষ্ট্রের সম্পদ রক্ষা, জনগণের জান-মালের হেফাজতে 'প্রপোশনেট ফোর্স 'এপ্লাই করতে পারে। এখনো তাই হচ্ছে, হয়তো বেশিও হচ্ছে। গোপালগঞ্জে কোন পুলিশ/আর্মী সামান্য আহত হয়নি, কিন্তু সেখানে রাজনৈতিক কর্মসূচীতে ৫/৬ জন মানুষকে বল প্রয়োগ করে বর্তমান ইউনূস সরকার হত্যা করেছে। এটা জেনোসাইড।

অথচ, বিটিভি, মেট্রোরেল, সেতুভবন, টোলপ্লাজা থেকে শুরু করে পুরো দেশে শত শত ব্যবসা প্রতিষ্ঠান, যানবাহন ধ্বংস করা হয়েছে, কারাগারে হামলা করে জ'ঙ্গি -সন্ত্রাসীদের মুক্ত করে দেয়া হয়েছে। পুলিশকে মেরে ঝুলিয়ে রাখা হয়েছে, এর বিপরীতে আত্মরক্ষায় নেয়া ব্যবস্থার বিরুদ্ধে বানোয়াট ভিত্তিহীন অভিযোগে ফাঁসির আয়োজন করা হয়েছে। সেখানে এই বটতলার উকিল বলে, আইনের ব্যতয় ঘটেনি। সময়ই বলে দিবে, কোনটা আইনে ছিলো, কোনটা না।

**Cross-examination;**  
Putting aside jokes and mockery, let’s see what kind of “lawyer” has been put forward in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s case. The entire world is calling this case a *miscarriage of justice*. The world says this case will remain an example of a farce in the name of justice. Police may apply “proportionate force’’ to protect state property and safeguard the lives and property of citizens. That is still happening—perhaps even excessively.

In Gopalganj, not a single police or army member was even slightly injured, yet during a political program there, 5–6 people were killed by the excessive force used by the current Yunus government. This is genocide.

Meanwhile, from BTV, metro rail, Setu Bhaban, toll plazas to across the entire country, hundreds of businesses and vehicles were destroyed; prisons were attacked and militants–terrorists were freed. Police officers were beaten and hung. In response, actions taken in self-defense have now been turned into fabricated, baseless accusations to stage executions. Yet this makeshift “lawyer” claims no law was violated. Time will tell what was lawful and what was not.

Those who are helping this illegal government and their militant allies will be punished under the existing laws of Bangladesh. That will be done through an “expedited” trial. There is nothing left to prove—everything is already proven.

I Just hate how most Bangladeshi people just cannot think rationally,"As the title suggests, I just cannot fathom how people in their mid-40s cannot have a rational mindset about anything. Last night a lot of my family members were invited for the celebration of my parents' 25th anniversary, and due to me being an admission candidate, the talk about what I was preparing for came up. I said I am prepping for DU B and C and their face went pale as I said something so blasphemous that their comprehension cannot imagine. Their first question was. ""you read science your entire life and passed HSC with great grades; why are you going for commerce or arts? Why are you not prepping for buet?"" and in response I said that I want to stay at BD, and the current engineering market is very bad, and I don't want to study in a discipline that has so little potential here at bd. and their response was there is a huge market for engineering at BD, and then they proceeded to say the most hilarious thing i have heard in a while. They said, ""Desher CSE er to onek demand."" I just wanted to laugh so hard. As I didn't want to argue with them, I said that ""mama, amar to eto brain nai CSE porar"" and left the living room and said to myself how unaware people are when they give any advice. When the potential of CS graduates getting a stable and good-paying job is at an all-time low in the entire world. when tech mammoths are laying off people, there are so many uncles that give this unsolicited advice. These people just cannot think for 2 minutes before spewing out uncalled advice, and the fact is they aren't illiterate or anything.

Getting Euro payments as a Bangladeshi,"Hello everyone!

I recently joined a European company that pays in Euros via Deel dot com.

I’m running into some issues receiving my salary.

Wise seems like a good option, but they don’t allow new accounts from Bangladesh. I’ve heard it might be possible to open a Wise account using a friend’s or cousin’s foreign address.

Has anyone actually done this, and did it work?

Also, Elevate provides online USD bank accounts. Is there any similar service for receiving Euros?

I’ve also looked into Payoneer for a Euro account, but their transaction fees are pretty high, and their service is bad.

I know I could convert Euros to USD inside Deel, but the conversion fee is quite high, and I’d like to avoid losing that much.

The same goes for direct bank transfers to local Bangladeshi accounts. Too much hassle and government fees.

Any workarounds or advice would be really appreciated.

Dhaka's traffic is getting worse and no one seems to care,"In a recent You Tube video You Tuber Luke Damant was asked to choose between Dhaka and Tehran in terms of living place. 
And his reply ""Dhaka is a dump, I'm not living there""

This comment may seem harsh but it's what it is. Dhaka's traffic is a huge part of this. And it has been made worse by uncontrollable amount of Auto Rickshaws. There are way too many Rickshaws and I don't think we need half of them. And not to mention, how dangerously they drive. 
                                                                                      The interim government hasn't done anything meaningfull in improving the traffic. On the contrary, they have made the situation worse by allowing so many Rickshaws.

Bangladesh is severely lacking in Public Libraries and overall access to books.,"There are over 9,000 public libraries and more than 125,000 librarians across the United States, all of which offer a wide variety of resources and services to the communities they serve. Similarly, Australia has a fantastic network of public libraries across all its states. Users can access an extensive catalogue of print, electronic, and multimedia resources as well as free Wi-Fi, computers, printing services, study spaces, groups, classes, and much more by joining a single library. 

According to the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, neighboring India also has an impressive library network, with approximately 1.5 million libraries, including 1.3 million school libraries—the highest single number of libraries globally. The country also hosts over 160,000 public and community libraries, with one public library for every 8,333 people, which is more than double the Asian and global averages. In Sri Lanka, according to the National Library and Document Services Board (NLDSB), there are approximately 1,500 public libraries—one for every 14,595 people. The respective local governments and urban and municipal councils govern all public libraries.

Compared to India and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh has only 71 public libraries, a disproportionately low number considering the population—resulting in there being one public library for every 2,402,143 people. How embarrassing is that? 

I gathered the above information from The Daily Star. For all the talk and complaining we do about ""lack of civic sense"" and political and social justice, we don't pay attention to the very real cause of it all, low access to education especially in rural regions and the distinct lack of libraries in this country. Instead of protesting for delaying or cancelling exam results or forming new colleges or other ludicrous purposes we should protest to increase the availability of books across the country, not just the Capital. This will undoubtedly encourage young under-privileged men and women who want to be educated but don't have the money to enroll in a school. And, as a result will instill civic sense, duty and national responsibility in them.",Honest_Ad_6090,63,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1p0f95k/bangladesh_is_severely_lacking_in_public/,2025-11-18 21:43:20,Dhaka

Government of the pressure group by the pressure group for the pressure group,"
Shafiq Bhai probably forgot to say another success of his Govt:
government of the pressure group  by the pressure group for the pressure group


The Interim Government is an NGO-Gram in all but name—a gram-level outfit!! In many views, it is the weakest administration in Bangladesh’s history: so weak that even the United States would not pursue reciprocal tariff arrangements with it!!

Its leaders often appear timid, unable to control the streets during a period that saw over 1,700 protests in 500 days!! They seem novice and ineffective, struggling even to pass laws, let alone enforce them!! The Interim Government has repeatedly buckled under pressure from relatively small or little-known groups!!

Over the past 15 months, the IG has been bombarded with accusations of inertia and incompetence. Many dismiss it as a “do-nothing, makhon-khawa group” that stumbled into power by luck and achieved nothing and now was looking for an ignominous safe exit!!!

And yet, when I look back, I say with confidence that this has been one of the most consequential governments of Bangladesh in many decades. It has achieved almost everything it set out to do.

#Peace and stability restored. Post revolution revenge attacks brought to a halt.

#The US tariff deal was secured without hiring a single lobbying firm.

#A record number of laws were enacted in just 15 months, including sweeping new labour reforms.

#The July Declaration established a historic new platform, and the July Charter created a political settlement that may reshape national politics for generations.

#The Supreme Court asserted control over the lower judiciary, making it far more difficult for future governments to weaponize bail decisions or pursue politically motivated cases.

#One of the world’s leading port operators signed the Laldia Terminal agreement, laying the foundation for a manufacturing transformation. It is the single largest European investment.

#A new foreign policy framework has positioned Bangladesh at the centre of the Indo-Pacific.

#The economy has been stabilised and returned to a growth trajectory.

#Banking-sector plunder was curbed, the taka stabilised, and inflation contained—food inflation falling from 14 percent to seven.

#According to court proceedings, accountability began to emerge for past abuses, and a long-awaited sense of justice has begun to take shape. Sheikh Hasina has been shown her place!!

#Forced disappearances ceased, the BAL extremist political culture that once dominated our national life has been neutralised, and a cultural revival has followed—bolstered by widely viewed documentaries detailing earlier abuses. It is a Farooki- effect!!

#The RAB now operates under the law rather than informal doctrines, and intelligence agencies have retreated from harassing dissidents. 

#Freedom of press and freedom of speech have been restored. Not a single staged “crossfire” incident has been reported in the last 16 months.

I could go on. As an avid reader of our history, I believe no government in Bangladesh has achieved as much in such a short period as the IG has over these fifteen and a half months.

Full stop.

do ways of making money online really exist? i need serious help. (please no khalid farhan type of advice),"I don't even know to start, I made a post a month ago about my despair of being a Bangladeshi citizen and being from an area where opportunities are limited for those who can't buy it. 



Now what about the ones who are really stuck in a situation they don't want to be? 

  
on the previous post that i spoke of, a lot of good guys tried helping me, and some of them said i should get a computer, and that it will open a lot of ways for me. i worked overtime in my shitty job and got a barely manageable laptop., but i don't know where to start, what skills will really be valued if i devote myself really. i started learning graphic designing and a cousin of mine said graphic designers are fighting each other in Bangladesh to get simple jobs and that there are thousands of new designers every day only in Bangladesh. so.... these are the kinds of advice i'm getting right now, and some people are advising me like Khalid Farhan if you know what i mean. 

  
But no one till now said ""i make money, and here's how you can too, just follow me"" i know that sounds demanding but if you have time, please talk to me, anyone. i'll tell you about me and you will know why i'm so desperate to find a way to make money instead of relying on my shitty job.

CU vs RU,"RU &amp; CU are both considered among mid-tier universities in Bangladesh. But when someone gets a chance to choose one of them, I can see most people choosing RU (If I am wrong, correct me). Why isn't CU considered better than RU? Is it because RU was established before CU, so people are biased towards it? Or is it true that CU is a level below RU? Today is the 60th anniversary of CU. CU is situated in the second most important city in Bangladesh. Many countries of the world have the best universities either in the capital or in the port city. CU has not been able to live up to its potential.

Need advice on what to do..for life..career..etc😭,"Need advice

So i basically worked at this Photoshop/photomela which I joined at first thinking I'll get to learn Microsoft office and other stuff which i did the first couple weeks from the other workers but.. after that i stopped learning stuff, i was there from 9am till isha prayer almost everyday, besides friday or if some mezban/urush/ biye etc type stuff was happening for almost 3 months, it became a job basically, i got paid like 50tk a day for my bus fare. The workers were nice tho ngl about that, even the owner was friendly but when it came to the money side and how long Iam ""working"" there they get pretty strict, obviously I don't like it anymore, i mean fair i learned quite a bit talking with different kind of customers and learning how to use adobe Photoshop and word etc. but.. is it really worth all that? Opening the shop at 9am and cleaning it up myself like... I don't know if im the one who's getting alot and still complaining or other way around, i only feel bad because the staff there were genuinely good people I liked hanging out with.... But that wasn't my goal at the start.. I joined in to learn.. which i stopped doing after awhile. Also another thing is.. Im one of those bekar unemployed, not studying anymore guys, that was the reason i joined this place like 3 months ago... I don't know what to do with my life, clearly this isn't it since im just wasting time here, but I don't know what else I can do...

Edit: thought I should share a bit about myself. Iam 19 years old, I used to live in Oman and came back to Bangladesh at 2022 because i had visa problems, I missed my highschool exams i was basically part of the 2022 batch of SSC examinees.. which i missed and i didn't study since, been 3 years, dad went to UAE 2 Years ago and I thought he'd take me soon.. its been quite awhile im still here.. it's kinda funny but anyways.. I don't know how much longer im gonna be here but I don't want to waste it, someone bestow some wisdom on me, im really broke so IELTS is not on the table right now, im saying this because i got suggested this one multiple times. Im really broke right now, not just me, my whole family, hence why Im still here in bd instead of going to UAE because I can't buy the damn visa and some other stuff. Anyplace i can learn some work.. whatever kind of work that would benefit me later on where I might be able to make some money aswell...

Is arranged marriage still a thing in Bangladesh for male in their early 20s?,"I’m a 23-year-old Bangladeshi currently studying in Australia and about to finish my undergrad. I’ve been here for around three years, have a stable income, and I’m considering getting married within the next 1 year so my future spouse can join me while I’m still studying.

Since I’ve been single for a long time (last relationship was in 2018–19), I’m trying to understand how realistic arranged marriage is nowadays for people in their early 20s. My parents are open to helping, but they are also unsure how the process works now since society has changed a lot.

Recently I’ve seen many online discussions about modern dating, trust issues, expectations, betrayal, etc., which honestly made me a bit confused about what the normal marriage process looks like for Bangladeshis today especially for someone living abroad.

For those who went through arranged or semi-arranged marriage recently:
	•	How did the process go?
	•	What should someone like me realistically expect? How do I do the genuine background check.
	•	Any advice for someone who wants a stable, respectful, religiously aligned partner?

I’m Muslim and try my best to practice, and I’m hoping to find someone who shares similar values. Would appreciate honest experiences and guidance.

I am getting really depressed because of this,"My mom actually studied Law at Dhaka University. She was an excellent student back in her day. But she couldn't pursue her career to take care of my older brother, who has autism.

I finished my admission exam in 25. I actually got a seat at DU B unit, but as it was a low-ranking subject, I decided not to pursue it after studying for a couple of months. I chose to enroll in a Private University to get a good subject.

Ig my mom didn't like that. Now, like in every argument, she tells me ""Kono public e chance peye dekhate paros nai"", ""At least amra nijer ma baba ke khushi korte parsi DU te pore"", and if I correct her sentences or oppose her arguments in any other topic, she just replies with ""Tui toh DU teo tike thakte parli na"" and shii.

Ik that DU is tuff for this country, but Idk, now I don't even wanna study anything anymore. Her arguments are seriously getting under my skin. Today we argued and she said ""Tor toh kono bhalo bondhu o nai, amar bondhu ra at least DU te porse, tui toh gazadi der sathe ghure beras"" like tf???? She doesn't even say sorry, and if I argue too much, she decides to spit in my face and call me ""Kulangar"" and a ""Devil's spawn"".

A couple of days back, I actually went to the private university I wanted to get admission in, just to check out the campus and to know a few details about the subject and the cost. My mom insisted that she come with me. I bought her along with me. I talked to the Apu at the office and got the details. BUT, when we were about to leave, my mom just stood up and told the Apu that ""Janen amar chele er ageh DU te chilo, and amio DU r student"". The girl sitting behind us just looked at me like ""Really, is this fr??"" I felt so embarrassed, I just walked out. So is anyone's mom like tis or am I just losing my mind over nothing?

In a school, there are 1,000 students. Among them, 330 students like basketball, 350 students like football, and 450 students like cricket.

80 students like both football and cricket, 110 students like both cricket and basketball, 55 students like both football and basketball, and 30 students like all three games.

1. How many of them do not like any game?

2. How many of them like only one game?

Total student =∪

Students who like basketball=A

Students who like football=B

Students who like crucket=C

What I did

n(A∪B∪C)-n(A∩B)-n(A∩C)-n(B∩C)+n(A∩B∩C)

=915-55-110-80+30

=700

And the way AI is doing it

Only A= n(A)-{n(A∩B)+n(A∩C)}+n(A∩B∩C)

330-(55+110)+30=330-165+30=195.

Only B= n(B)-{n(A∩B)+n(B∩C)}+n(A∩B∩C)

350-(55+80)+30=350-135+30=245.

Only C= n(C)-{n(A∩C)+n(B∩C)}+n(A∩B∩C)

450-(110+80)+30=450-190+30=290.

We need to talk about the border killing issue happening at the Indian border.,"We need to talk about the border killing issue happening at the Indian border.

So,we know that years after years hundreds of Bangladeshis get killed in the India-Bangladesh border.
The excuse given by India is that they were crossing the border illegally.
Now,we know that there has been several instances where some farmers or other people unknowingly went to the other side and then faced the terrible fate at the hands of their BSF.
My question is, can we not raise awareness among our people about to stay INSIDE our borders,to not FLEE from it?
Perhaps we should increase our border patrol and the infrastructure around the border to make our borders MORE SECURE to prevent inflitration AND to prevent anyone even ""accidentally"" going to the other side of the border.
I personally believe this will drastically decrease our border killings.
We cannot just blame everything on India and wait for them to tell their BSF to not use lethal weapons(because that clearly didn't work).
Nevertheless,we should put more diplomatic pressure to ensure our citizens do not lose their lives

2. What is their purpose, and what do they actually do in these relationships?
3. I see that both religious and non-religious people sometimes say they never want to get married and prefer to live independently. What does that actually mean? Don’t they have desires or physical needs?

I’m tired of struggling… but I’m still trying. Need some honest advice.,"Lately life has been really heavy for me.
আমি জানি, পৃথিবীতে অনেক মানুষ struggle করে, কিন্তু আমি নিজেও একটা phase এর মধ্যে আছি যেখানে মনে হয়—
“আমি কি কখনও ঠিক পথে দাঁড়াতে পারব?”

আমি আমার জীবনে অনেক চেষ্টা করছি — সঠিক পথে হাঁটার, নিজের জন্য কিছু তৈরি করার, পরিবারের জন্য ভালো কিছু করার।
But every time I take one step forward, life pulls me two steps back.

Financial চাপ, পড়াশোনা/কাজের অনিশ্চয়তা, লোকজনের কথা, চাপ, দায়িত্ব… সব মিলিয়ে কখনও কখনও মনে হয় আমি একাই লড়ছি।

আমি রাতে জেগে থাকি, ভাবি—
“আরও কতদিন এমন চলবে?”
“আমি কি সত্যিই succeed করতে পারব?”
“নাকি শুধু চেষ্টা করেই যাব?”

কিন্তু তার পরেও…
প্রতিদিন সকালে আমি আবারও চেষ্টা করি। আবার উঠে দাঁড়াই।
Because deep down, I believe আমার জীবনও বদলাতে পারে।
আমি জানি আমি give up করতে চাই না — বরং support আর guidance চাই।

যদি কেউ পড়ে থাকেন…
Please বলুন—
আপনারাও কি জীবনে এমন কঠিন সময় পার করেছেন? কিভাবে উঠে দাঁড়িয়েছেন? আমি কি করতে পারি?
I’m not looking for sympathy…
Just some honest advice, motivation, বা আপনার নিজের গল্প।

Which BUTEX Textile Engineering Department Should My Younger Brother Choose? Need Honest Advice,"

Hi everyone!
I’m posting on behalf of my younger brother. He’s a science-track student who scored GPA-5 in both SSC and HSC. This year, he has applied to several places—medical, BUET, and a few general universities. He’s also applying to BUTEX, but he’s a bit confused about choosing the right department.

BUTEX has around 11 different departments under Textile Engineering, and since he’s not very familiar with the textile field, he isn’t sure which ones offer better career opportunities, industry demand, research potential, and overall student experience.

If anyone here is a current BUTEX student, graduate, or has experience in the textile industry, your suggestions would be really helpful. Which departments are the most promising right now? And what should he keep in mind while selecting his preferences?

Laptop Issue,"I’m having a serious issue with my Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3i (15IIL05) and need some expert advice. The laptop was originally bought in 2021 and worked fine until I replaced the display in early 2024 due to scratch marks. After about a year, the new display started glitching, showing a horizontal white line and occasionally going completely black. Over time, the screen stopped displaying anything except a faint backlight. I tried updating drivers, reinstalling the OS, and even detaching the HDD, and the laptop worked briefly before a charger accidentally fell on the keyboard from about 40 cm. Since then, the display has been blank again, although the system still powers on. Multiple technicians couldn’t identify the issue, with guesses ranging from GPU to cooling problems. Battery health is also poor. Now, the laptop only shows a dim backlight with no image. I need help figuring out the real cause and whether it’s something repairable possibly a cable issue, display failure, or something else. Any guidance would be appreciated.

I WANNA KNOW ABOUT JAGANNATH UNIVERSITY,"ভাই আমি তো বিশাল বিপদে পড়সি। আমার বাপ মায়ে আমাকে জগন্নাথের ফর্ম তুলতেই দিবে না। এদের ধারণা এটা নাকি কোনো ভার্সিটির কাতারেই পড়ে না এখানে নাকি ফেল্টু/ কোনোমতে পাশ করা পোলাপান পড়াশুনা করে। আর এখান থেকে পড়লে নাকি ফিউচারে কোনো সেক্টরেই দাম পাবো না।সিভি তে এই ভার্সিটি দেখলেই নাকি সিভি ছুড়ে  ফেলায় দিবে।

এদের অভিজ্ঞতা তাই বলে।

এখন ভাই আমি লো মিড লেভেলের স্টুডেন্ট। HSC তে GPA:4.83। টার্গেট A unit। এমন না যে একটা ভার্সিটিতে বসলেই চান্স পেয়ে যাব। তাই জগন্নাথে যদি না বসতে দেয় এরা তাইলে তো আমার জন্য বিশাল লস হয়ে যাবে। তার উপ্রে আমি বড় হইসি ঢাকা শহরে ঢাকায় ইই থাকার ইচ্ছা। তাই এম্নে একটা পাবলিক ভার্সিটি হাতছাড়া করা যায় না।

কিন্তু বাপ মায়ের কথা ""না এখানে তুই চান্স পাইলেও তোরে পড়াবো না। এর চেয়ে ভালো তুই বাংলা কলেজে ডিগ্রি করবি।""

"I’m soft, I’m tired, I’m trying and that’s enough. My heart is loud, even if my presence isn’t.","I have always been a quiet, calm, unnoticeable observer my entire life, but not a typical introvert.  Introvert but a different type that only understands by few. Not because I dislike people or friendships, but because my heart moves slowly. I connect deeply, not quickly. I have a small circle, and it takes me a lifetime to truly let someone in.

The last few years have been messy for me. And a few months ago, I pushed myself to step out of that shell I had lived in for so long. I tried to explore life more, talk to people more, socialize more, and allow myself to feel a little lighter.
But now I feel exhausted in a way that is hard to explain.
Overwhelmed. Drained. Lost.
Like I took ten steps forward just to end up standing in the same old place again.

I don’t want to distance myself from the few people I genuinely care about, because I don’t want misunderstandings or to seem uninterested. But at the same time, I feel like I can’t handle too much anymore. My mind needs silence but my heart doesn’t want to hurt anyone. And this conflict is eating me up.

I don’t think everyone would understand this sudden wave of emptiness I’m feeling — how it comes without warning, how it makes my efforts feel wasted, how it reminds me that healing is not a straight line. It’s confusing, and honestly, painful.

Still, I won’t give up. I know life requires adjusting, and maybe this is just another phase I need to breathe through.
I just wanted to share this here, without being judged or misunderstood, because writing feels like my only escape sometimes.

If any of you feel the same way, you’re not alone. You can share your thoughts too or tell me what helps you survive these phases.
And whatever you’re going through, please be kind to yourself and to others. We’re all carrying things we don’t talk about.

অনেক বাংলাদেশি অভিবাসীর সবচেয়ে বড় বাধা প্রায়ই তাদের নিজের কমিউনিটিই হয়। একটি সাম্প্রতিক ঘটনা দেখিয়েছে—কীভাবে একজন লোক ব্যক্তিগত বিরোধের কারণে নতুনদের সাহায্য করার জন্য তৈরি একটি সাপোর্ট গ্রুপকে নিজের ইচ্ছামতো গেটকিপিং করছিল। বিষয়টি জানার পরও সিনিয়র সদস্যরা গুরুত্ব দিয়ে দেখেননি,"Translated my previous post. 

সবার প্রতি সালাম, আমি জেমস—অবশ্যই আমার আসল নাম নয়, পরিচয় গোপন রাখার জন্য।

ঘটনাটি শেয়ার করার আগে কিছু প্রেক্ষাপট দিচ্ছি। আমি কয়েক বছর আগে অস্ট্রেলিয়ায় আসি। প্রথমে অন্য একটি বড় শহরে পড়াশোনা করি, তারপর ভালো সুযোগের জন্য কুইন্সল্যান্ডে চলে আসি। আল্লাহর রহমতে বিভিন্ন জব করেছি এবং ২০২২ সাল থেকে স্বাস্থ্যখাতে পড়াশোনা ও কাজ করছি—এখনও করছি।

বাংলাদেশ থেকে যারা আসেন তারা জানেন, স্বাস্থ্যখাতে বাংলাদেশি দেখা কতটাই বিরল। আমার ক্লাসে বা কর্মস্থলে কখনও কোনও বাংলাদেশি পাইনি। গত ৩.৫ বছরে কুইন্সল্যান্ডে আমি মূলত ফিলিপিনো, ইন্ডিয়ান, নেপালি ও অন্যান্য জাতিগোষ্ঠীর সঙ্গে কাজ করেছি। তাদের কমিউনিটি যতটা ঐক্যবদ্ধ দেখে, সেটা আমাকে অনুপ্রাণিত করেছিল বাংলাদেশি কমিউনিটির সঙ্গে যুক্ত হতে। আমার অবশ্যই লোকাল বন্ধু আছে, কিন্তু একে তো সংস্কৃতির একটা টান থাকে, আর আমি কখনও আমার সংস্কৃতি থেকে দূরে থাকতে চাইনি। আমি সত্যিই চেয়েছিলাম এমন কিছু মানুষ পেতে যাদের সঙ্গে ভাষা, সংস্কৃতি, ব্যাকগ্রাউন্ড মিলে।

একটি গ্রুপ ছিল, যেটি কুইন্সল্যান্ডের একটি বাংলাদেশি স্টুডেন্ট অ্যাসোসিয়েশনের সাথে যুক্ত। কেউ আমাকে সেখানে অ্যাড করেছিলেন। জুলাই ২০২৪ এর প্রোটেস্টের পর গ্রুপটি বেশ সক্রিয় হয়ে উঠেছিল—মানুষ পরস্পরকে সাহায্য করছিল, কানেক্ট হচ্ছিল। কিন্তু আমি যোগ দেওয়ার কয়েক মিনিট পরেই হঠাৎ আমাকে গ্রুপ এবং চ্যাট—দুটো থেকেই ব্যান করে দেওয়া হল।

গ্রুপটির অ্যাডমিন—ধরি তার নাম এন—সে আমার এক কাজিনের বন্ধু। কয়েক বছর আগে আমাদের মধ্যে ব্যক্তিগত একটি ঝামেলা হয়েছিল, যা কমিউনিটির সঙ্গে কোনও সম্পর্ক ছিল না। সে সেই পুরনো বিষয়টি ভুলতে পারেনি এবং অ্যাডমিন ক্ষমতা ব্যবহার করে ব্যক্তিগত বিরোধের কারণে আমাকে ব্যান করে দিল।

শুরুতে তেমন পাত্তা দিইনি। কিন্তু কিছুদিন আগে যখন আমি রেন্টাল ভ্যাকান্সির পোস্ট দিচ্ছিলাম, তখন ঘটনা বদলে যায়। ভাগ্যক্রমে আমি এমন জায়গায় থাকি যেখানে মালিক আমাকে ঘর সাবলেট করতে বিশ্বাস করেন। এভাবে কিছু বাংলাদেশি রুম খুঁজতে এসে আমার সঙ্গে যোগাযোগ করল, এবং শেষে তিনজন বাংলাদেশি আমার বাসায় উঠল।

প্রতিদিন তাদের সাথে আমার নিজের ভাষায় কথা বলতে বলতে বুঝতে পারলাম—এতদিন আমি এই কানেকশনটা কতটা মিস করছিলাম। ৩–৪ বছর শুধু ইংরেজিতে কথা বলে এবং স্বাস্থ্যখাতে বাংলাদেশি না পেয়ে, মাতৃভাষায় স্বাভাবিক কথোপকথনই যেন মন শান্ত করে দিয়েছিল।

তাদের একজনের সাথে আমি তাহসানের কনসার্টেও গিয়েছিলাম। সেখানে এক সিনিয়র ভাইয়ের সঙ্গে—ধরি তার নাম এস—দেখা হল। উনি খুব ভালোভাবে অভিবাদন জানালেন, আমি পুরো ঘটনা বললাম। উনি বললেন দেখবেন। কিছুই হয়নি, এবং সত্যি বলতে তাকে দোষ দিই না। তার পরিবার-দায়িত্ব আছে; বেশিরভাগ মানুষ এমন ক্ষুদ্র ঝামেলায় জড়াতে চান না। তাই এটাও ছেড়ে দিলাম।

কিছুদিন পর কেউ একজন এন-এর বিরুদ্ধে অভিযোগ পোস্ট করল—একজনকে হুমকি দেওয়া এবং রাজনৈতিক সংযোগের ইঙ্গিত নিয়ে। তখন আরেকজন সম্মানিত কমিউনিটি লিডার—ধরি তার নাম এ—পাবলিকলি লিখলেন যে বুলিং, হয়রানি বা বৈষম্য কাউকেই ছাড় দেওয়া হবে না।

আমি তাকে ব্যক্তিগতভাবে জিজ্ঞেস করলাম,
“যদি যিনি এগুলো করছেন তিনি কমিউনিটি লিডার হন, তাহলে?”
তিনি বললেন, ভুল তো ভুলই।

তখন আমি তাকে পুরো ঘটনা খুলে বললাম—কীভাবে আমি শুধু নিজের কমিউনিটির সাথে সংযোগ করতে চেয়েছিলাম, সাহায্য করতে ও নিজেও কানেক্টেড থাকতে চেয়েছিলাম।
ভাই এ এন-এর সাথে যোগাযোগ করেন। কাজিনকেও বললাম বিষয়টি। আমি একটাই কথা স্পষ্ট করলাম—পুরনো ব্যক্তিগত ঝগড়াকে অজুহাত বানিয়ে কাউকে কমিউনিটি থেকে বাদ দেওয়া অন্যায়। অ্যাডমিন হওয়া মানে কারও উপর ব্যক্তিগত ক্ষমতা খাটানোর লাইসেন্স নয়।

কাজিন এবং ভাই এ দু’জনই এন-এর সাথে কথা বলার চেষ্টা করেন, কিন্তু সে বিষয়টি এড়িয়ে যায়। শেষে সে শুধু জানায়—সে আমাকে গ্রুপে নেবে না। কোনও যুক্তি নেই, কোনও ব্যাখ্যা নেই—শুধু জেদ।

অনেকে সহজেই বুঝতে পারবেন আমি কার কথা বলছি, কারণ এর আগেও তাকে বাংলাদেশের একটি রাজনৈতিক দলের সাথে জড়িত বলে অভিযোগ উঠেছিল। মজার বিষয়, সে নিজেই বলেছিল সে দলের নয়, কারণ সে নাকি তাদের বিরুদ্ধে “প্রোটেস্ট করেছিল”—কিন্তু তার আচরণ ঠিক সেই গত দশকের দেশের রাজনৈতিক চরিত্রগুলোর মতো।

সে এমনকি আমার কাজিনকে বলেছে কিছু নির্দিষ্ট আত্মীয়কে নাকি অভিযোগ করবে এবং “অ্যাকশন নেবে”—মানে পরিস্থিতি বাড়াতে চাইছিল, অথচ আমার উদ্দেশ্য ছিল শুধু ন্যায্যতা। আমি কাজিনকে বললাম—মানুষ জানুক বা না জানুক, আমার আপত্তি নেই; আমি শুধু চাই অন্যরা জানুক কীভাবে কিছু লোক ভদ্রতার মুখোশ পরে ব্যক্তিগত শত্রুতার বদলা নেয়।

দীর্ঘদিন ধরেই তার আচরণ নিয়ে বিভিন্ন মানুষের কাছ থেকে গুজব ও অভিযোগ শুনেছি—যেগুলো আমি বলব না, কারণ তার মতো পেছনে লাগা বা অপবাদ দেওয়া আমার উদ্দেশ্য নয়।

যা আমাকে সবচেয়ে বিস্মিত করেছে—সে আমাকে ব্যান করলেও, স্বাস্থ্যখাত সম্পর্কিত কোনও তথ্য জানতে কেউ তাকে জিজ্ঞেস করলে সে আমার নম্বর তাদের কাছে দিয়ে দিত।
কারণ “এন ভাইয়া আপনার নম্বর দিছে”—এই কথাই শোনা যেত।
মানে, তার নিজের প্রয়োজনে আমি ভালো, কিন্তু কমিউনিটিতে আমার থাকা সে মেনে নিতে পারে না।

আমি প্রচুর জাতিগোষ্ঠীর মানুষের সাথে কাজ করেছি—অস্ট্রেলিয়ান, পাঞ্জাবি, ফিলিপিনো, নেপালি, সাউথ ইন্ডিয়ান—কিন্তু এমন নোংরা গেটকিপিং আর কোথাও দেখিনি। যাদের কাছে গিয়েছিলাম তারা চেষ্টা করেছেন—সেটা আমি সম্মান করি—কিন্তু বেশি কিছু করার ছিল না।

তাই হ্যাঁ—এমন সাপে ভরা মানুষের ব্যাপারে সতর্ক থাকুন। তারা বাইরে থেকে হাসিমুখে সাহায্যকারী সাজে, ছোট্ট কোনও উপকার করলে দশজনকে বলে বেড়ায়, অথচ আড়ালে ক্ষমতার অপব্যবহার করে। যে সত্যিকারের সাহায্য করে, সে চুপচাপ করে; সে ক্ষমতা দেখিয়ে মানুষকে অপমান করে না।

আমার ব্যক্তিগত ভাবে তেমন কষ্ট নেই। আমার কাজ ও পড়াশোনা ভালোই চলছে, আল্লাহর রহমতে সব ঠিক আছে। দুঃখ শুধু এই—বিদেশের মাটিতে নিজের কমিউনিটির সাথে কানেক্ট হতে চেয়ে, সংস্কৃতির টান বজায় রাখতে চেয়ে, কেউ একজনের ছোট মনের কারণে এমনভাবে দূরে সরিয়ে দেওয়া হয়।

সত্যিকারের সদাচরণ নীরব।
সত্যিকারের নেতৃত্ব ব্যক্তিগত আবেগ নয়, কমিউনিটির স্বার্থ দেখে।

এমন ভণ্ড, ছদ্মবেশী মানুষ থেকে সাবধান থাকুন। নিজের পরিচিতজনদেরও সচেতন করুন।

আর যদি আপনারা জানেন কীভাবে এমন মানুষদের ব্যাপারে আরও বেশি মানুষকে সচেতন করা যায়, তাহলে আমাকে জানান।”",jbttss,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1oycgiz/অনক_বলদশ_অভবসর_সবচয_বড_বধ_পরযই_তদর_নজর_কমউনটই_হয/,2025-11-16 10:32:02,Dhaka

Since the dawn of AI, my career has been suffering a lot on freelance platforms.Tried working offline jobs as a graphic designer but I never enjoyed it. 
Can't find jobs as an artist either. I was super introverted during the beginning of my career where I didn't focus on my 'Social Branching Skills'. Now that I'm trying to do that, seems like I'm already too late.

Breaking the ice now, I was, I am a bit scared to post on social media or reach out to people as well.

Seeking Investment to Scale My Small E-commerce Brand (Bangladesh) — Need Guidance &amp; Partners,"Hi everyone,

I’m building a small e-commerce brand called Chikbik, focused on budget-friendly toys. I started this business with very little capital and have been running it alone — sourcing, importing, marketing, fulfillment, everything.

To show transparency, I’m attaching my lifetime earnings screenshot from my shop. This is what I’ve built with zero investors and limited resources.

What I’ve Achieved So Far

Built an online presence on Facebook &amp; Marketplace

Started selling imported toys

Built a base of repeat customers

Managed all operations independently

Monthly sales increasing slowly but steadily


Why I Need Investment

Right now the main constraints are:

Limited working capital

Unable to bring bigger stock

Want to create a more branded experience

Need funds for packaging, marketing &amp; improved product line


My Goal

To turn Chikbik into a recognizable small toy brand in Bangladesh, with:

Better branding

More product variety

Dedicated marketing

Stable inventory flow


What I’m Looking For

A small to mid-level investor

Someone who understands e-commerce in emerging markets

A partner open to discussing equity sharing

Mentorship is also welcome


What I Can Provide

Full transparency (I’ve shown my earnings screenshot)

Clear growth plan

Constant reporting and performance updates

A motivated founder who works full-time on the business


If anyone is interested in discussing or guiding me, I’d appreciate any advice or conversation.

Or let's say western films, even 90s films had really unique plots, and characters of books and films, or even random people were much smarter in fashion and behavior. They had a depth in personality. If you'd see students of our universities around that time, even they looked really smart. Do you ever think why? Maybe I'm an old soul and love old things.

Trying to collect foreign currency notes — where can I actually get my first ones in Dhaka?,"Man, listen… I’m a student here in Dhaka, and I’m trying to start collecting **foreign currency notes**. Sounds simple, right? WRONG. Because I realized I have never — and I mean *never* — held foreign money in my hands. If you threw a euro at me right now, I’d be like, “Dang! Is this what rich people feel like?!”

I tried checking with the banks.  
They hit me with, “Sir, do you have a passport? Visa? Travel plan?”  
And I’m standing there like, “Passport?? I don’t even have travel *dreams* yet! I got NID and student ID — that’s the whole package!”

So now I’m here asking the people of Reddit before I embarrass myself again:

* **Where can I get my first few foreign notes in Dhaka without all the hassle?**
* **Anybody know legit collectors, shops, or online spots where they don’t try to hustle you?**
* **Should I start with the cheap old-school notes first?**
* **And yo, what scams should I watch out for? ’Cause I ain’t tryna get played like that.**

If you got advice, drop it here. Don’t leave me out here struggling like Smokey on a Monday.

I GOT FIRED FROM MY JOB AT THE FIRST DAY,"So, there's this hospitality group in Bangladesh hired me as the role of marketing officer. I didnt know much about them, so i simply made a post in a Facebook career assist group and simply asked about the company and the salary they are offering. So that night the HR called me and told me to delete the post immediately and told me it was really immature of me to make a post like this. I simply apologised and delete the post immediately. Later the next day was off day and I was suppose to join from today (15th of Nov). So i was told to be present there at 10 am. After that, the receptionist told me to wait for the HR and I waited for like 2 goddamn hours. Then they told me to go the cabin where HR and the manager were present. They let me sit and told me that we aren’t continuing with you because of the post you made (are you fucking kidding me!?) I simply said that it was my right to know about your company since your digital presence isn’t visible enough. Then she dared to threat me saying that, 'eshob khetre amra police case kore thaki, apni fresher dekhe kichu korini' duh. Tarpor the manager started giving me lecture but i left the room right away. They were kept saying that miss we arent finished yet PLEASE kotha shunun Like DUH you've wasted  my 2 fucking hours now you want me to listen your lecture????

App that shows live Bangladesh Railway train positions - Find My Train: Bangladesh,"Hi everyone,  
I built an Android app '**Find My Train: Bangladesh**', to help people track Bangladesh Railway trains in real time. The app shows the live position of running trains so you can locate your train easily. My goal is to make train tracking simple and helpful for everyone.

You can try the testing version by following these steps:

**Step 1:** Join the tester Google Group [(link here)](https://groups.google.com/g/mytraintrackerbd) \[ [https://groups.google.com/g/mytraintrackerbd](https://groups.google.com/g/mytraintrackerbd) \]

**Step 2:** Install the app from the Play Store [(Playstore)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app) \[ [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app) \]

Note: Without step 1, step 2 won't work. If the app does not appear, please make sure you are using the same Google account for both steps.

After trying it, if you notice any issue in loading, tracking, or timing, please share your feedback in the comments.

Does Milestone College charge extra fees for taking a TC?,"I got into Milestone College this year, and at first I thought I could manage everything. But over time, I’ve been getting frequent burnouts, I get sick often, and the long daily commute is draining my energy.And the college says to maintain 100% attendance but It is becoming difficult for me to maintain attendance as required. 
Because of this, I’ve been thinking about taking a TC (Transfer Certificate) and switching to a place that’s easier for me to handle.

Before I make any decisions, I wanted to ask:
Do colleges like Milestone usually charge extra fees for issuing a TC?
If anyone here has taken a TC from Milestone — or any ex Milestone student knows abt this— I’d really appreciate knowing:

How much did it cost (if anything)?

Was the process difficult / long?

Any tips to make it smoother?

Any tips for dealing with if they don't  hand the TC easily (would be appreciated)?

I just want to understand what to expect before I move forward.

should i change schools and take commerce?,"my finals are starting from like this thursday and today during lunch my mother just asks me if i want to take a gap year change school and like change subjects like in science rn but but even when i was in 7th grade my parents agreed that i would commerce in 9th grade because i was already horrible and maths and i personally dont think i am smart enough to be a science student not like ill fail in my annuals although i did in half yearly but that was entirely because i didnt even touch my books,but this time i swear i really am trying its not like i am gonna get to the top overnight but atleast i wouldnt fail and i am expecting to for more than just a passing grade.but the problem is that i have been telling my parents since september of last year that our school doesnt have any other subject except for science and in college although they do have commerce and arts both those subjects are taught in bengali and i am an ev student now i am not terrible at bangla but ik i would survive that.                                                                                                                                    so when i tried to speak about changing schools with my mother at the beginning of this year she lashed out on me calling me lazy and saying that my life hasnt even started yet and ik zero things about hardship and like i am trying to find an easy way out by changing schools and i took that blow personally and me doing sb like literally failing in half yearly has everything to do with my being irresponsible towards my academics but like i said i am really am trying this time but there are times when i just feel so stupid and like feel like i have no job even studying science like my mother agreed that she would like get me into a diff commerce collage after ssc but like ik i genuinely dont have what it take to survive in  a public admission test like ill do well in ssc if i just try hard enough but idk what happens after that and nw literally just a week before my finals starts my mother is asking me if i want to change school and take commerce but idk if she had asked me that even a week earlier my answer would have been yes without a second thought but i just really dont know right now what i am supposed to do like i just felt like she was joking with me even then i just can not do this honestly although i do think in the long run it will be better if i changed schools and took commerce but what i am really worried about if like repeating a year would mean ill appear a year older than i was supposed to be in all of my certificates and thats the part i am most worried about",vernoniestacos,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1oxp48x/should_i_change_schools_and_take_commerce/,2025-11-15 17:11:09,Dhaka

I have 2 lakhs to invest | need suggestions to generate 30k–50k/month within 2–3 months (Bangladesh),"Hey everyone,  
I’m looking for some solid guidance and ideas.

I currently have **2 lakhs taka** that I can invest into something productive. My goal is to start generating **30,000 to 50,000 taka per month** within the next **2–3 months**. I can stretch my personal expenses a bit, so I’m willing to take calculated risks just nothing extreme.

A bit about my background so you can suggest better:

* I’ve worked **2+ years as a Business Development Manager** (client acquisition + client management + scaling accounts) Before that I worked as a Freelancer on Upwork since 2021 and had Top Rated badges on there.
* Experience in **telemarketing**, **WordPress web design**, **affiliate marketing**, **social media marketing**, and **client hunting**
* Previously collaborated with **international call centers**, providing them with projects and helping them operate
* Overall, I have a good understanding of **digital money-making models**, but I’m now looking for something more strategic or higher-ticket

What I’m hoping for:  
A **realistic roadmap**, investment ideas, or business models where my experience fits and where 2 lakhs can be enough to get started. Sometimes one suggestion from someone else’s experience can open a whole new direction so I’d really appreciate your input.

If you’ve built something similar before or know someone who has, please share what worked for you.

"Should I Do a Master’s/PhD Abroad? Average Student, No Passion, Married, and Scared to Go Alone","
Hi everyone,
I’m really confused about my future and need honest, experience-based advice from people who’ve studied abroad.

A bit about me:
	
•	I’ve always been an average-but-capable student. I’m not the type who studies out of curiosity or passion, but if something needs to be done, I do it properly.
	
•	My parents pushed me to study my whole life, so academics became a routine, not a passion.
	
•	I got into a top engineering university in Bangladesh and kept a CGPA above 3.5, mostly by studying hard during finals and class tests.
	
•	I did my undergrad thesis seriously and completed it well, but I don’t have the drive to turn it into a publication now.

Here’s the key thing about me:
If I have to study something — even something I don’t enjoy — I will sit down, push through, and complete it properly.
Difficult course? I’ll grind through it.
Boring topic? I’ll still learn enough to get a good result.
I’m disciplined when required, just… not naturally passionate.

But I’m also someone with no specific research interest. No favorite field. No topic I feel excited about. I don’t enjoy reading research papers. I don’t have that “curiosity spark” people talk about in academia.

Another important piece:

Studying has always been my comfort zone because that’s all I’ve ever done. I didn’t participate in extracurriculars, clubs, or competitions. My entire life has basically been “study and survive.” So whenever I’m lost, my mind automatically goes back to, “Maybe I should study more.”

Right now I’m genuinely stuck:

•	I’m not applying to private jobs.

•	I’m not studying for government jobs (and        honestly, those don’t attract me at all).

•	I’m just drifting without direction.

Emotionally, things are complicated:

•	Living away from home in undergrad was difficult.

•	Everything became easier after I married my long-term partner because he was there with me.

•	I also had close friends who studied with me, discussed everything, and kept me motivated.

If I study abroad, I’ll be alone — no husband, no built-in support system, no study group.
And since I’m already unsure about academics, the idea of managing studies + loneliness feels terrifying.

So I want honest answers from people who’ve actually lived this:

1.	How hard is a Master’s or PhD abroad for someone like me — disciplined enough to get work done, but not passionate?

2.	Is it risky to start a research degree when you don’t have a specific research interest?

3.	Do people find passion later, or is that just a comforting myth?

4.	How emotionally tough is life abroad when you’re married but going alone?

5.	Can someone like me actually handle the pressure, or is this setting myself up for burnout?

6.	Should I work for a while in Bangladesh to understand myself before deciding?

My thoughts are all over the place, and I’m really lost. Any honest advice would mean a lot.

Thanks in advance.

Wife is very mean and rude to other,"My wife — along with her mother and sister — is often very mean and rude to others. Her mother used to hit the household help, and my wife grew up seeing that. She knows that I dislike such behavior, but she continues doing things that are hurtful. She doesn’t get along with anyone: not with my mother, not with her own mother, and not with any helping hand. She behaves as though everything must go exactly her way, immediately, without consideration for others.

Recently we hired a helping hand to take care of our daughter, and my wife made her life extremely difficult. She treated her very harshly, almost like she wasn’t a human being. She used very hurtful language toward her—for example saying things like *“Khodar khasir moto khacche bose bose”*. The truth is, the girl didn’t even eat much, and even if she did, I don’t understand why it would be a problem. I believe that rizq is from Allah, and by His grace and mercy I can afford the household expenses. I have repeatedly asked my wife not to behave like this, and especially not to make comments about someone’s rizq. It is her provision from Allah; we have no right to question it. But my wife didn’t care.

In the end, to protect the helping hand from more mistreatment, I convinced my wife by saying that the girl was not doing anything important, and maybe we should send her home. My wife agreed, and we sent her back. When she was leaving, the girl was crying — and it really broke my heart. I feel terrible, and sometimes I cry privately in the bathroom so my wife doesn’t see it. I don’t know what to do. Is this normal? Do most families treat their helping hands this way? When I was growing up, we never had household help. We weren’t financially well off back then, and my mother did everything by herself.",Swimming_Crew_5054,125,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1ox8zph/wife_is_very_mean_and_rude_to_other/,2025-11-15 03:23:15,Dhaka

Is it possible to be a visionary politician in Bangladesh?,"I mean,I have some visions.
Some of them are grand.
I want to change Bangladesh.
I don't want us to be known as the ""labourers of the Arabs and Malaysians"".
I don't want our students getting scammed by companies who promise a life abroad for better opportunities.
I don't want our people to stay being stuck in traffic around 4-5 hours a day.
I don't want our rivers to encroached upon,and I no longer want any dead canals.
Elite areas like ""Banani"",""Gulshan"" they get flooded if there's a little heavy rain.
This is not acceptable.
We live below bare minimum conditions.
And no,I won't compare ourselves with our neighbours nor with war-torn countries.
We should compare ourselves to those who are higher up than us,not with other mediocre   nations or those who are in pretty bad shape.
Our target should be compare ourselves to the developed world,to see them as the standard and apply the changes through our context.
Most of the people of our country are only concerned with ""ajkey ki khabo,kalke ki korbo"",and that's honestly okay,cuz normal citizens are just...normal citizens.
But don't you think we need visionary leaders who actually think 20-30 years into what type of Bangladesh we should build?
For now,I see no vision from any party.
What type of Bangladesh do we want in the next 20-30 years?

I don't want চাঁদাবাজি,extremism of any kind,poor facilities etc.

Most of our cities look dead,you feel nothing seeing them.
Why doesn't our urban planners think about improving the aesthetics of our city?
The young generation likes to tong er dokane e adda,and I'm not saying that's wrong,but I don't see them thinking deeply about the country either.
What's gatekeeping us honestly?
