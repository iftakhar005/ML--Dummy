HISTORIC VICTORY FOR THE COUNTRY!!!,"Bangladesh ended a long wait for victory against India with a 1-0 win in their AFC Asian Cup Qualifier in Dhaka, secured by an early goal from Sheikh Morsalin after a strong run and assist from Rakib Hossain in the 11th minute. The hosts controlled much of the first half and survived a scare when Hamza Choudhury cleared a goalbound Indian effort following a defensive mix-up. Hamza nearly scored himself just before the break, while both teams played mainly for pride since neither remains in contention for the 2027 tournament. The win is Bangladesh’s second of the year after their friendly triumph over Bhutan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1p0h1s7/historic_victory_for_the_country/,Plastic_Repeat_995,66,9,2025-11-18 22:50:10,bangladesh

Bd domestic flights,"Hi, i am coming to BD from Finland next week. I will land in Dhaka. Then I want to take a domestic flight to Chottogram. I will have 40kg (2x20) luggage and 8kg (1x8) hand luggage with me when I am coming to bd.

Wake up Bangladeshis,"The government collapsed in July–August 2024 after a student-led protest because citizens demanded merit over quota. Sounds noble, right? Except the whole thing was hijacked from the very beginning.

Those naïve, illiterate social-media activists and the “cool Dhaka kids” who wanted some good Instagram content ran to the streets without realizing a basic truth: BNP–Shibir gundas hijacked the movement on day one. They staged everything. They used those same cool Dhaka kids as puppets. They manipulated every moment of it.

And nobody ever stopped to ask a single real question:

Who are these NCP “student leaders”? What are their qualifications? What drove them to lead this protest? When did these uncles disguised as students actually graduate? What have they done with their lives besides student politics?

The same people who screamed about merit are now perfectly happy letting these criminals become the next representatives in government.

I am not supporting one side over the other. I am simply asking everyone to think for once.

Do you really want to live in a cave and pretend that:

The Awami League government falling automatically turned Bangladesh into a civilized, developed South Asian utopia under Dr. Yunus?

Because here is the reality:

Yunus is not making any key decisions. His cabinet is. And they were chosen based on quota, not medha.

In any functioning country, an interim government must be neutral, not tied to any political party. But our current administration is doing the exact opposite. Whenever NCP orders Yunus to do something, he complies out of fear.

And honestly, this feels exactly like what the plan was all along.  
People forget he formed Nagorik Shakti (Citizens’ Power) back in 2007.  
Connect the dots.

This government is intentionally delaying elections while handing NCP an open license to operate. Meanwhile Nepal had a government collapse and their interim immediately declared election timelines… exactly what an interim is supposed to do.

Yunus is enjoying his new status and free private flights to new destinations on taxpayers’ money, while the Bangladeshi cool kids think being “politically conscious” means trash-talking a party that has already fled the country, or using fancy buzzwords to blame foreign nations instead of holding the current administration accountable.

Now let us talk about the outcome.

There is no solid evidence that the original cause gained anything. It is a full-on shitshow.  
The trial was a shitshow because it means nothing.  
The world is literally laughing at Bangladesh.

Death sentencing people in absentia is a joke, but people ate it up and celebrated anyway.

What did the interim actually change?

The economy is collapsing.  
Murders, robbery, theft, rape statistics are skyrocketing.  
The garments industry is struggling with hundreds of factories shutting down.

But sure… the so-called “student leaders” are making slogans and people are cheering like everything is fine.

And then there is the new trend online.

People are making cool edits of Lutfor Zaman Babor, acting like he is some hero out of a Netflix series. Why is everyone blindfolded? or why the “student advisors” who magically appeared out of nowhere suddenly became the face of the movement. Not a single person questioned what medha qualified them to “advise” ministerial portfolios. But somehow they went from nobody to VIP overnight. Rags to riches, just like that.

And then there is the sudden obsession with Tareq Zia, who has now become everyone’s eye candy. People act like reposting aesthetic edits of corrupt political bloodlines is activism.

Study history. Learn about their smuggling stories. Learn about JI.  
Look at patterns.  
You are being emotionally manipulated by social media every single day.

Do not let TikTok edits and Facebook reels generate your political opinions. Think for yourself. Stop idolizing netas who have done nothing for you.

Blaming “the West” or “India” will not take Bangladesh anywhere.  
Blaming outsiders is the easiest way to avoid looking in the mirror.

Educate yourself.  
Learn the facts.  
Stop being a pawn in someone else’s political game.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1p05vor/wake_up_bangladeshis/,Hot-Point-4090,2,1,2025-11-18 13:39:20,bangladesh

Best place to live in Bangladesh?,"Hi, what’s the best place to live in Bangladesh? I dislike Dhaka so much that it’s hard to even put it into words. These days I feel nauseous just breathing the air outside. I work remotely and plan to continue doing so, which gives me the flexibility to relocate.

I’ve already discussed this with my parents, and they’re willing to rent out our apartment in Dhaka and move somewhere nicer if we can find a good place. I also worry a lot about the risk of a major earthquake. people laugh it off, but it feels like only a matter of time before Dhaka faces something serious. So I’d prefer a place that’s relatively safer in terms of earthquakes. Also, with good medical facilities near by, as my parents are getting old and I don't want to risk anything.

What do you think about Rajshahi? I really liked the city when I visited. The only downside is that it gets extremely hot. Would air conditioning be enough to stay comfortable?

How Yunus Deceived BNP at the Last Minute,"I think you all know that the Interim Government has finalized the referendum date and its question. However, some of you may not realize that they played dirty with the BNP at the last minute. Let me explain how.

The BNP submitted a note of dissent on many of the proposals recommended by the Consensus Commission. The IG and the Commission were not satisfied with the outcome. That's why they initially tried to ignore the BNP's note of dissent by not incorporating it into the July Charter, but they were forced to do so when the BNP stated they would not sign it otherwise. Then they attempted to disregard the BNP's note of dissent again by framing the referendum question in such a way that the reforms desired by the IG, the Consensus Commission, and most parties would have a higher chance of receiving a YES vote. Just look at the options if you don't believe me.

[Referendum Question](https://preview.redd.it/gr8i1kcaze1g1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d24cc22d8eca02fba65b2c52cd94bf5f29e3009)

  
  
This was not supposed to happen. The purpose of the Consensus Commission was to include only those proposals in the referendum that received consensus from all 30 parties. I know the content of the first two questions did not, don't remember about the third option though. Only the fourth option reached consensus.

The BNP can't fully oppose this because if they do, they would be labelled anti-reform by almost everyone. Notice that other political parties like Jamat, NCP, Gonoodhikar Parishad and others aren't talking much about the question either because they are supportive of what the IG is doing as they benefit from it. 

The BNP has already hinted that they will not accept the result imposed on them by some elites.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1oxqjxw/how_yunus_deceived_bnp_at_the_last_minute/,Alone-Attention-2139,35,35,2025-11-15 18:31:25,bangladesh

The doctor asked us to play with her give some specific games to play and we are doing it for last two months and there is not improvements.

Anyone using Finasteride or Minoxidil? Need advice and good doctor recommendations,"Hey everyone,  
Im a 26 year-old male and I’ve been struggling with hair loss from a pretty young age. I have been visiting a doctor who prescribed me some medicines which I have been taking for the last 3 months.

Recently, he suggested that I go for a **hair transplant** and also take **PRP treatment**. When I asked if I could recover some of my lost hair, he told me that whatever is gone is gone and that the only solution now is a transplant.

But I have seen some of my friends who had worse hair loss than me. They said they used **finasteride** and **minoxidil** and that it helped them. Finasteride stopped their hair fall and minoxidil helped regrow some hair.

I did a bit of research and found that both drugs are **FDA approved** and can give results as long as you keep using them. So I asked my doctor about using finasteride and minoxidil but he didn’t prescribe them. He said these only help maintain existing hair and won’t bring back the lost ones.

Honestly, its discouraging because Im spending around 10k per month but Im told there is no chance of recovery. It is just for maintenance. I don’t want to go for a hair transplant yet and I also don’t want to use any medication without proper medical guidance.

So Im thinking of **changing my doctor**, hopefully to someone who is experienced in treating hair loss and open to trying finasteride/minoxidil under supervision.

**I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone in Bangladesh (specially Dhaka):**

* Are you using **finasteride** or **minoxidil**? What kind of results have you seen?
* Any **recommended dermatologists or hair specialists** in Dhaka who treat hair fall properly and guide patients with these medications?

I just want to get some honest opinions and maybe find the right doctor who can help me recover whatever hair is still possible to save.

My Story,"I’m a 21-year-old boy. My father has schizophrenia. After I was born, my mother couldn’t breastfeed me. I’m the first child in the family, and when I was four years old, my little sister was born. My mother became very busy with her, and I didn’t get the time or care I needed.

When I was a child, I used to spend most of my days outside, playing with my friends. They felt more like my family than anyone else. I would visit their houses and stay out until evening.

When I was about seven or eight, I started to learn swimming. One day, some pond water got stuck in my ear and caused a terrible infection. My ear began to rot from the inside, and it was extremely painful. My father refused to let me take antibiotics, so for days I suffered before being treated with homeopathic medicine.

When I was nine, my parents decided to move away. Leaving my friends behind broke my heart. The new place was quiet and lonely. I stayed home most of the time, surrounded by my parents’ constant fights. My father often left the house early in the morning and came back very late—or sometimes not until the next day. My mother would yell all day and curse him. Both of them worked as primary school teachers. I felt trapped in their arguments, and I often thought about dying.

After finishing 10th grade, I left home to live with my maternal uncle in the capital city. I couldn’t really share my feelings with anyone.

During my final year of high school, my father was admitted to the hospital for open-heart surgery. I visited him several times between HSC exams. His surgery went well, and he returned home, but he remained weak and struggled to breathe. Around that time, one of my aunts suddenly died of a heart attack, which shocked everyone.

While my father was recovering, I wanted to return to Dhaka for my studies, but he was too ill. My mother and I argued a lot. My mind was exhausted—I couldn’t rest, and I couldn’t focus on studying. After more conflict with my mother, I finally returned to Dhaka and joined a coaching center to prepare for the engineering admission exams.

Preparing for those exams is hard as we know. At my uncle’s house, there were problems too. I was moved into the drawing room to study and sleep, and I couldn’t concentrate at all. I cried to my mother for help, but she didn’t respond—she was overwhelmed with my father’s illness. My uncle’s family, meanwhile, was celebrating the birth of a new child. While I was struggling and crying for help, there was laughter all around the house.

Ever since I was little, I loved machines. I always wanted to be an engineer. My mother knew this. I used to take apart my toys and gadgets to see how they worked—flashlights, radios, even a television. I started learning programming (Python) when I was in class nine. But my parents and relatives all wanted me to become a doctor. They kept pressuring me, and I couldn’t study properly.

Eventually, I took the engineering admission exam but couldn’t get a good rank. I wasn’t surprised, because I hadn’t been able to study properly through all that stress. Still, there was one more chance—a central exam for 24 universities. I studied hard for a month and did well in the test. But in the end, I failed because of corruption in the system. That's another story.

Now I’m studying Computer Science and Engineering at a private university. In my first semester, I achieved a CGPA of 4.00 out of 4.00. I’m doing well academically, but I often feel depressed when I think about my life. I have no real family bond, I’m not in a top public university, I don’t earn any money, and I never received the love or care I needed from my parents.

Sometimes it feels like I have nothing.

Why doesn’t Bangladesh have a soft power strategy?,"Japan exports anime and manga. Kpop is also popular in Bangladesh due to their soft power strategy. India has soft power in Bollywood. Pakistan also increasingly has soft power in Bangladesh due to their cricket team and many women wanting Pakistani man.

Why doesn’t Bangladesh develop soft power strategy. Given it is a clothing exporter powerhouse they can develop soft power in fashion like Japan did. Today, people go to France or Japan for shopping because the value is in the branding and design, not just production. I myself shopped in Japan and went to their stores like Uniqlo. When someone sees Tiger or Mizuno shoes they associate with Japan, and France with LVMH. There is no reason Bangladesh can’t develop aspirational clothing brands with the supply chain they have. Bangladesh in addition to West Bengal was the textile capital of world so tradition is there. 

Second thing is cricket. Sport is a great way of showing soft power. Thats why Saudi is throwing money at football and the Qataris and Emiratis sponsor so many leagues. Today, people worship England because they have EPL. People love Spain because they have Barcelona and Real Madrid. Cricket is second most popular sport in the world so Bangladesh should develop its T20 League with a clear cultural EXPORTING strategy. Just like Manchester United have overseas fans and plays exhibition matches abroad Bangladesh teams such as Dhaka Capitals and Khulna Tigers should do the same and develop global following in cricket playing nations. 

These are just two ideas I have.

Need advice on future plans for studying Physics.,"Hi everyone. I'm a student from Bangladesh, I'll be starting my undergrad soon and I want to major in Physics.

For postgrad, I want to do my master's degree and PhD in theoretical physics at a top university abroad. I want to build my career in research and/or teaching theoretical physics.

To go through with my plan, I would need a fully funded scholarship for my Master's and PhD, as it's impossible for me to pay for education abroad. Unfortunately I don't have much idea about scholarships. If anyone can help me with what scholarships I could apply for and what opportunities they could be for me, that would be greatly appreciated. I'll also have 4 years ahead of me before my Master's, so I think that's enough time to prepare myself. So basically I need help with the idea of a roadmap.

The Daily Star is covering a series called **“Challenges in Policing,”** and the **first part expose a system that is collapsing under financial misery**, the **second part reveals:** many of the people responsible for our security are living in conditions that strip them of basic human dignity.

The barracks at **Banani Police Station** stand inside one of Dhaka’s richest neighborhoods, surrounded by glass towers and luxury apartments. But step inside, and the contrast is shocking. Officers sleep on rusty metal beds packed together inside suffocating rooms where even ceiling fans cannot be installed because the ceiling is too low. Case files are prepared sitting on beds because there are no desks. Bags are stacked on stairwells, walls are damp, the rooms are cramped, and pest control is a fantasy. Bedbugs bite them at night, mosquitoes during the day. Forty-two men share two toilets. There are no cleaners; officers clean the floors themselves after 12–14 hours of duty before they are allowed to rest.

**The problem is not limited to Banani.** At Shah Ali Police Station in Mirpur 1, the situation is worse. There is no kitchen, so constables must eat outside, spending a quarter of their salary just to survive. There is not enough space to sleep. Some officers sleep on mosque verandas, some in community centers, and during busy weeks, many sleep on footpaths. Privacy doesn’t exist. A constable says he cannot even speak to his family over the phone at night because there is nowhere quiet to stand. There is also no rest area for reserve police officers—they sit outside for hours on chairs or rickshaws waiting for their shift to start.

**These conditions are not just humiliating**—they affect policing. When a person is exhausted, living in heat, sleeping among insects, and working without rest, **can we really expect them to remain patient, professional, and morally firm every day?** We talk about police misconduct and corruption, but we never ask what happens when a system breaks a person down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1oj3wxl/challenges_in_policing_part_2_those_who_provide/,AtikulIslam4142,19,4,2025-10-29 19:02:01,bangladesh

A young woman on a local Dhaka bus was verbally harassed over her clothing. When she protested, the man slapped her and no one did a thing. People watched, filmed, and scrolled later.

This incident highlights the wider reality for women in Bangladesh: public transport can be unsafe, and many women spend extra money on private rides just to feel secure. According to BRAC's *Safe Roads for Women* report (2018), 94% of Bangladeshi women have faced harassment—verbal, physical, or otherwise—on public transport. A 2022 survey by UNDP, NHRC, and CRI found that 87% of women across 24 districts have been harassed at least once in their lives.

But this young woman fought back with a sandal, standing her ground. She represents millions who cannot: women who shrink in their seats, clench their fists in fear, and remain silent because speaking up often brings more scrutiny.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1oj1995/পশক_নয়_কটকতকরক_জতপট_করলন_তরণ/,AtikulIslam4142,207,93,2025-10-29 16:50:00,bangladesh
Challenges in Policing (part 1): Inside the broken funding of BD police,"[The Daily Star](https://preview.redd.it/x4rkbeqo0vxf1.png?width=1298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e8dba991e969b6abb6ad167a635f6e0ea3b64f2)

As David Hume stated, *Justice has no utility where there is superabundance.* For BD police, justice has no utility when the system is starving. **Before we talk about reforming police behavior, we must understand the system they are trapped inside**

The Daily Star is covering a series called **“Challenges in Policing,”** and the first part expose a system that is collapsing under financial misery. Police stations cannot function with their current budget. Officers are sent to investigate murders with only Tk 6,000 from the government, when the **real cost is at least five times higher**. In one case, recovering a decomposed body in Ashulia cost Tk 9,100 before the investigation even began. The sub-inspector had to pay from his own pocket.

Because there isn’t enough allocation from the state, many police stations now survive through what officers openly describe as **“special funds.”** These funds are created through unofficial channels—*donations from businessmen, local political elites, and money taken from people who are desperate to get their cases moved forward or suspects released after bail. This doesn’t just create corruption*—**it makes corruption a requirement to keep police stations running**.

**In Dhaka,** a police station receives Tk 40,000 a month as source money for operations, but spends over Tk 80,000 a month simply giving refreshments to daily visitors, many of whom are political figures. The station needs around Tk 1.5 lakh a month for basic supplies like paper, fuel, bulbs, toilet cleaners, and maintenance, but receives only a fraction of that every four months. Even detainees legally get Tk 30 per meal, but a basic meal today costs almost three times more. Police often end up feeding them from their own salaries to prevent starvation.

Vehicles are old and barely functional, making it impossible to respond to emergencies quickly. Fuel allocations are so low that officers sometimes rent private vehicles just to conduct operations. Officers admit the truth: they cannot meet public expectations because the system forces them to beg for funds informally. This is how integrity breaks—not always by personal greed, but by structural design.

**Reform proposals already exist.** The Police Reform Commission has recommended more investigation funds, better operational budgets, a transparent audit system and direct funding for superintendents. But nothing changes if no one pays attention. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1oiabnu/challenges_in_policing_part_1_inside_the_broken/,AtikulIslam4142,10,2,2025-10-28 20:06:52,bangladesh

Abduction or staged drama?,"[Muhibullah Miaji walking quickly by himself](https://preview.redd.it/jivytltvdpxf1.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4a309a14fc5e8e0113077ad93a0e2c22c529fff)

Mufti Muhibullah Miaji, the Khatib of T&amp;T Bazaar Jame Mosque in Tongi, [went missing on October 22, 2025](https://www.kalerkantho.com/online/country-news/2025/10/23/1595919). He was found the next day, October 23, in the Helipad area of Panchagarh Sadar Upazila, **chained to a tree by his leg and in a naked state**. Local residents discovered him and informed the police, who rescued him and admitted him to Panchagarh Adhunik Sadar Hospital.  
Muhibullah claimed he was **abducted in an ambulance, tortured overnight**, and that he had been receiving **anonymous threat letters** before the incident. Some Islamic groups have protested in Panchagarh and demanded the arrest of those responsible.

**When speaking to journalists** from his hospital bed, [Mufti Muhibullah provided a detailed account of his alleged abduction](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1D4osQWsEe/) and the motives behind it. He claimed that around 7 AM on October 22, while he was out for a walk after Fajr prayer, **five men** in an ambulance forced him inside by covering his face. He alleged that they then subjected him to **inhumane torture**, including being stripped, severely beaten with a water-filled bottle on his thighs, and having his beard shaved off. He stated the five men spoke **""standard Bengali""** but did not sound like Bangladeshis, and they threatened to harm all Islamic scholars.

He claimed his abduction was the culmination of **months of threats** delivered via anonymous letters. According to his statements and the First Information Report (FIR) filed later, these letters, allegedly from ""ISKCON terrorists,"" demanded that he preach in his mosque sermons:

1. In favor of **Akhand Bharat** (Undivided India).
2. In support of the release of **ISKCON leader Chinmoy Das**.
3. Against **Islam-based political parties, BNP, and NCP**.
4. A **fatwa** stating that there is no barrier to love between **Muslim girls and Hindu boys**.
5. To **stop using the words Allah, Muhammad, and Islam** in the mosque.

He alleged the letters promised him a **large sum of money (crores of rupees)** if he complied, or threatened him and his family with death and harm if he refused.

Following the widespread outcry over the alleged abduction and torture, particularly with Islamic groups in Panchagarh staging protests against ISKCON, an investigation was launched. 

**However,** subsequent findings have cast serious doubt on Mufti Muhibullah's claims, leading [police to place him under investigation](https://www.kalerkantho.com/online/national/2025/10/24/1596268). Several CCTV camera footage from the area and time he claimed to have been abducted show Muhibullah Miaji **walking quickly by himself**, but there is **no footage of anyone forcibly picking him up** or of an ambulance stopping to take him away.

Despite claiming to have been tortured for nearly a day and a night, Muhibullah was observed to have **returned to normal life** and gave a speech to his congregation shortly after being released from the hospital. The content and language of the anonymous letters he produced also raised suspicions. Critics pointed out that the letters contain a mix of seemingly contradictory devotional terms (""[Jagat Joyi Kalimata"" and ""Buddhadev](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BUY8f2pty/)"") and use words like **""Adhikarik""** which he himself noted is **not standard Bangladeshi official language**.

After these inconsistencies came to light, Mufti Muhibullah was **interrogated by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)** and later admitted to a hospital in Dhaka, becoming unavailable for further comment.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1ohnd6w/abduction_or_staged_drama/,AtikulIslam4142,29,31,2025-10-28 01:05:53,bangladesh

"As a Hindu Bangladeshi, it's so hard to have conversations with people about Bangladesh","I live abroad now and I've started to shut down any conversation about the country now because it feels like everyone I talk to is insane. 

If I'm talk to an Indian Hindu, they say the most insane Bangla-phobic Hindutva Islamophobic stuff about our country and tell me I'm brainwashed and a Muslim lover when I push back. I'm brainwashed?? From the person who successfully convinced themselves Hindus are actively being rounded up and shot in the streets right now in Dhaka?

If I'm talking to a Bangladeshi Muslim, they often dismiss any fears/worries I have about the safety of Hindus in the country and just talk over me saying that Hindus in Bangladesh are safe and there's nothing for anyone ever to worry about as if that isn't a crazy exaggeration. If I speak too much about my worries, I'm called a BAL supporter and told to ""go back to India"". What's worse is some of the people who say this stuff are diaspora people who visited Bangladesh once when they were 7 and formed their opinions based on that. Who are you to say anything to me when you've never lived there and don't even speak Bangla?

I'm exaggerating obviously(most of my Bangladeshi Muslim friends are great and many Indian Hindus I know are also normal people who don't believe the propaganda) but it feels so awful that I can't have a nuanced conversation with most people in real life about Bangladesh. 

Criticizing anything about NCP or the current political and social situation in the country gets you labelled a BAL supporter. Or braindead Hindutva people think bc I criticize one thing about the country I agree with their propaganda. Conversation about everything is so polarized. People blaming that rapist's actions on Hindus and using it as an excuse to be Hinduphobic as if though rapists don't come from all religions and types of people. Maybe they don't remember 2020 and 2015, but I do. And then there are the disgusting people who are defending that man's actions just because he's Hindu and people think Hindus can do no wrong. Equally terrible. 

Sometimes, it genuinely feels like there's no normal, sane people left to have a conversation with. Sorry for the rant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1ofjxl6/as_a_hindu_bangladeshi_its_so_hard_to_have/,LeadingSea6037,107,28,2025-10-25 11:54:42,bangladesh

I strongly despised those comments. I brought it up in the student TG group to see how others felt, and it honestly sent shivers down my spine to see almost everyone supporting that lecturer’s stance.

When I went to the library, I saw that the entire library was completely dark.WTF is this?How does an institution's library stay dark? During class time?Seeing this, my whole family was heartbroken and I was driven to get this thought out of my head...

Fire at Dhaka airport's cargo section; Connecting the dots; Why does this whole thing feel so orchestrated?,"The flames rose from Chattogram's EPZ on October 16, seventeen firefighting units battling an inferno that seemed almost too well placed. 

Two days later, smoke billowed from Gate 8's cargo village at Dhaka's international airport—another critical chokepoint ablaze. Coincidence?
Perhaps. But operatives in the Great Game don't believe in coincidences. 
Especially when Bangladesh's Army Chief Gen Waker-uz-Zaman made an unannounced visit to abandoned World War II era airstrips near India's 'Chicken's Neck' corridor on October 16 the very day an Indian Military Intelligence team departed Dhaka.
Three helicopters ferrying the general to Thakurgaon and Lalmonirhat, districts hugging the border with India's vulnerable 22-kilometer-wide Siliguri Corridor that connects seven northeastern states to the mainland. 

The tradecraft was textbook: create chaos in commercial zones while testing strategic positions near your adversary's most fragile geographic asset. 

In the shadowy calculus of intelligence warfare, synchronized industrial fires could serve multiple purposes distraction, economic pressure, 
pre positioning for larger operations. And with Pakistani ISI and Army officers recently visiting Rangpur, just 130 kilometers from the Chicken's Neck the chessboard was filling with players.

Seeking doctor recommendation for PCOS,"

Hello everyone,

I have been dealing with PCOS for a long time and have consulted several well-known gynecologists and endocrinologists in Dhaka. Unfortunately, most of them focus almost entirely on fertility and recommend trying for pregnancy which is not my priority right now.some doctors even don't listen what actually i want.

My main concerns are severe hair fall, persistent fatigue, difficulty concentrating, poor sleep, and skin issues. Despite following a healthy diet and exercising regularly, these problems continue to affect my daily life, productivity, and confidence.

I am looking for a doctor who genuinely listens, understands the broader impact of PCOS beyond fertility,and provides practical advice for managing symptoms and improving overall health. I want guidance on how to balance hormones, reduce hair fall, improve sleep, enhance concentration, and manage skin issues effectively.

If anyone knows a gynecologist or endocrinologist in Dhaka who addresses PCOS comprehensively and doesn’t just focus on pregnancy, I would be very grateful for their recommendation.

Thank you so much for any hep.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1o9rwcs/seeking_doctor_recommendation_for_pcos/,nasia_musarat,5,1,2025-10-18 16:04:37,bangladesh

Struggles as an English medium student,"I come from a lower-middle-class family. My parents were former villagers, and they had high expectations for me, so they admitted me to an English medium school. However, despite being born in Dhaka, I could never mix well with other English-medium students because of my inferiority complex. 

 That’s one of the main reasons I never had any friends growing up. I rarely went out unless there was a specific reason, and my parents weren’t financially well-off enough to take me to different places or restaurants.

Now that I’m 20, I feel completely clueless about restaurants, good tourist spots, or how to socialize, since I still don’t have any friends. I also lack good social and dressing skills.

Jobless for 10 months now.. Anyone else going through a similar struggle?,"Hello everyone, or at least anyone that's reading this. I'm not sure how to structure this post properly, but it will probably read more like a rant than anything else. I'm just looking to kinda scream into the void.

I'm 27 now. I got my first job at the age of 14, which was a creative writing job. I don't remember all too well, but it was a very underpaid job which was like 1200 words was $3 or something. Didn't really mind. Game is game.

And that's where I started my freelancing journey. It probably needs to be emphasized that I didn't have a normal childhood, I was taken off education at an early age of 11, so I spent the rest of my time getting better at English, computers and just general internet literacy. I was lucky enough to have had a Pentium 4 with a 1 GB RAM computer that was handed down to me and I remember struggling so much to run even basic programs.. but it got me started and kept me going when I had nowhere else to go.

Fast forward a few years, I become more proficient at English and general tasks, and take on transcription and translation based jobs. While supporting what little I can for my little dysfunctional family (Mom, little brother, me). Due to constantly being under financial stress, we probably had to move homes I would say.. a total of 25-30 times until now? Anyway.. I guess I made what I had Infront of me as a career and this gave me a chance to work at Augmedix when I was 18. 25k job. Though I hadn't gotten in for their scribing project, it was a different project at the time which was an annotation project (code based transcription for AI training), but since it was a temporary experimental project it was shut off after 6 months, and me? Laid off. I didn't have the educational qualifications needed for their scribing department and it was a requirement.

So I set my gaze on online jobs and came across Amazon Mechanical Turk. With the help of a boro bhai, I was able to set up a computer in US that we remotely used to.. well, work on the tasks on the platform. The person in US did take a small cut, but it was negligible. I would make around 5-10 dollars a day by working for 12-14 hours which probably wasn't a whole lot, but it did keep me afloat for a long time pretty much until 2020.

Honestly the pandemic era wasn't so bad for me, I barely used to go out anyway so it hadn't been much of a change for me, however what was a change was the influx of jobs in the market. A lot more work started to become available online and people weren't super focused on educational aspects, and this landed me a great job at Appen (now called CrowdGen). It was a Bengali transcription job, and seeing my effort and good English, I was quickly made into a project manager. Pay was $2.5 an hour. I was ecstatic. But good things never last too long. At least not in my case. By the time I was done paying all debts around us and just started experience ""shochcholota"" this project too was abruptly taken off at the 5 months mark.

After this I fell back into the same place again and well, went back to Amazon Mechanical Turk. Earned whatever I could, and started picking up some video editing skills though my PC wasn't really capable of keeping up with it. I tried many call center jobs too in the middle of this, but I.. I don't know why, but I feel debilitated when it comes to working in call centers. I never fared well, no matter how many times I tried. I became deathly depressed to the point I would rather take my life instead of working in another call center.

2022 rolls on, and due to the rise of AI, Amazon Mechanical Turk slowly started to lose all it's microtasks and this resulted in.. well, becoming homeless. Me, my little brother and my mom, we spent an entire month on the streets. We used to somehow spend nights in various hospital lobbies and benches, parks, even spent a few nights at Kamalapur station. Probably the darkest days of life and my family. My little brother fell off a rickshaw and ended up being hurt really badly to the point he couldn't move one of his leg. This prompted me to ask for help desperately from all the friends I knew. And one of them did help me out. His parents were incredibly kind souls and helped us out with almost 20k worth of money, not counting how they helped with food, clothes, and even mugs and plates. We managed to get a tiny ""chilekotha"" room for 8k a month, but even that felt so relieving. We finally had a place to stay after being on the streets for an entire month. I remember spending the new year (2023) on the roof of that house and feeling free.

While living in this tiny place, I tried one last time to work in a call center where the pay was genuinely good at $3 per hour, but by the end of the second week I was throwing up everyday before my shift from anxiety, I was having constant panic breakdowns during calls, and.. yeah. I couldn't bring in the results they had hoped for, as well as my deteriorating call quality because we only had a single room. We actually had to go out to take a shower, the stove was in the exact same room we slept in, there was no way to wash the dishes other than taking it downstairs, it wasn't really a convenient place for a job that requires you to work at night in a quiet environment. But I still l wish I somehow could've rewired my brain to work at this place. Anyway.. So I went onto search more jobs and through the help of a mutual, I landed another job as a dispatcher for a US transportation company that operated from Bangladesh. Pay wasn't great, only 25k and I had to travel from Mohammadpur to Uttara to work, but.. it was still work.

I actually had help from this r/Dhaka in 2023 where I explained my situation and how important it is for me to move to Uttara for my job after the horrible situation we had been in, and well, how our quality of life was in that chilekotha. I then moved to Uttara 18 (RUAP) with the help of the people from this sub as well as my boss from the workplace. It felt so amazing to live in a flat again, haha.

So.. I don't know what it is, whether I'm just a bad luck charm or my fate is just meant to be horrible, the company I mentioned I was working in? They had to downscale drastically after I was working 4 months there. In the beginning, the person who hired me did so because he couldn't handle the amount of work he had. We were handling the dispatching of 6 trucks. By the time the 4th month rolled around, one of the driver crashed and went out of business, the main contractor (4 trucks) got kicked out of his company and that turned into a single truck, and the other driver became less regular at his work due to health issues. So after cutting down my pay to 15k, he just couldn't afford keep me anymore so well, I got laid off once more at the 6th month.

We started getting pushed down by debts once more, 3 months of rent became due and that's when the best job until now came along. Actually I got my contract just 2 weeks prior to our civil war. It was a job from TelusDigital, but they were being subcontracted by Bytedance. Basically, we were working on the algorithm for TikTok Bangladesh. My first lakh-taka job. Though the process rigorous in itself, I still passed all of their insane tests with flying colors and even helped 3 other pass. I was the best performer in the job for 18 weeks straight. I was happier than I had ever been. 5$ per hour, 1 year contract, I was convinced I would get out of my situation as long as I diligently worked at this role.

But yup, you probably guessed it at this point, their AI/algorithm was ready at the 6 months point and they laid off everyone despite the 1 year contract. I couldn't really save any money either because I paid off the dues from before, and bought a fridge, some basic household items, and a laptop for my little brother. When I was laid off, I did pay 4 months of rent in advance, but we started struggling to have even basic meals. In this time, I tried whatever I could do, content creation, learning to code, making a SaaS, graphics design, nothing panned out. Luckily through the help of an old friend from Augmedix, my little brother (16) managed to find a job of his own. He is working in the making EMRs (Electronic medical records) for doctors in the US, and I couldn't be prouder of him. It pays only 20k, but he's doing what I haven't been able to in the past.. 9 months now.

The thing is that.. the debt has piled on so much now that we've been told by the house owner to move out next month if we can't pay off the dues. And I'm deathly scared of landing on the streets somehow again. My little brother doesn't earn enough for us to move, advance, and find another new place. I shouldn't even be relying on his income anyway, but I've probably applied to over hundreds of places now without anything panning out. Experience doesn't mean anything if you don't have an education.

And I guess that's my TED talk, guys. My life and struggles so far has amounted to absolutely nothing. I'm just a nobody failure, and it honestly hurts. The only reason I don't give up is because I can't give up. My mother and my brother doesn't have anyone but me. I can't bear to see them suffer, my mother crying from hearing all the debters saying horrible shit, my brother not being able to sleep in peace because he feels like we'll become homeless again.. I am supposed to be their beacon of light, yet I'm just.. fucking useless.

Even some had abortion.I was in doubt how can she not have sex in 2years?She even justified things like ""sex krlei sarajibon eksathe thaka lagbe emon na"","" sex to mistake"" while talking abt her frnds.After sharing id pass i went to her story archive saw her male frnds and past relationship stories.She went to movie date(one day she told me she knows wht people do in movie date),i saw her male frnds kole niye chobi tulse,she story dicche proudly🙂also so many male interactions,male frnds stories.I saw in her messenger she was telling a frnd she did visit her ex even after 1year of their brkup,she received gift from him.She dated multiple boys after brkup🙂
I was shocked.I never expected this.Now i think all the desperation she showed was not love,was to bag a good guy,to get rid of her past.The insecurities that she had sex grew up so fast🙂i ended that relation forcefully, now im broke.I feel nothing about the world.I gave her my whole heart,i even fixed my marriage with her we planned everything 🙂I just cant sleep now.She was my first love,my only love.I had so many things to do in plan when she will come to dhaka.Everything is gone.What can i do🙂Should i go back to her or let this go.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1o72m5n/relationship_advice/,Famous_Divide6434,10,29,2025-10-15 11:29:13,bangladesh

"Help Me Pick a 43"" TV Under 50K Taka (Dhaka Buyers — Need Your Real Advice!)","Hey folks,  
I’m planning to buy a new TV and could use some help from the local experts here.

**My Budget &amp; Use Case**

* **Budget:** Max 50,000 Taka
* **Size:** Preferably **43 inches**
* **Usage:** Mostly watching TV shows and movies (usually 720p–1080p, not 4K).
* **Streaming habits:** I don’t really use Netflix or Prime — I’m more of a *Stremio / downloaded content* kind of viewer 😅
* **Gaming:** Occasionally hook up my laptop via HDMI for some light gaming (no graphics heavy titles).

**Query 1: Smart TV Suggestions**

Given my use case, what are some **good smart TV models** that fit within my budget?  
I’d love something with decent picture quality and smooth performance for 1080p content.

**Query 2: Non-Smart TV + TV Box Combo**

I’m also open to **buying a non-smart TV** if it has a really good display panel.  
I can always use a **Mi TV Box** or **ONN TV Box** to make it “smart.”  
If you’ve seen any solid non-smart options in this price range, please drop your suggestions!

**Query 3: Your Personal Experience**

If you can’t recommend anything specific — no problem!  
Tell me about **your own TV** instead:

* What model are you using and where did you buy it from?
* How long have you had it?
* Any issues or regrets? How has the performance been so far? Did the performance degrade/TV interface get laggy after a few years?
* How was the **after-sales service** (if you needed it)?

Bangladeshi cuisine,"# Hi everyone!

I’m a student at HSE (Higher School of Economics, Russia), and I’m working on a **creative project about Bangladeshi cuisine** — and I really need your help 🙏

I’ve spent days watching travel vlogs, reading food blogs, and asking AI tools — but they keep mixing Bangladesh up with India or Pakistan.  
So I’m turning to real people who’ve **been there, lived there, or simply know the culture well.**



# 🍛 Questions I’d love your insight on:

1️⃣ How is **Bangladeshi cuisine different from Indian**, besides the obvious religious aspects (like beef)?  
Are there unique **flavors, spices, or cooking techniques** that define it?

2️⃣ What are the **“iconic home dishes”** — the ones families cook all the time, like borscht in Russia or pasta in Italy?

3️⃣ Are there **regional food differences** within Bangladesh — say, between Dhaka, Chittagong, or the coastal areas?

4️⃣ What’s considered a **festive or celebratory dish**? What do people cook for weddings, holidays, or big gatherings?

5️⃣ How is food usually **served or eaten** — banana leaves, metal plates, clay dishes, hands? Is presentation important?

6️⃣ What’s typical for **tea time** — are there unique snacks or sweets that differ from Indian mithai?

7️⃣ Do some dishes or ingredients have **symbolic meanings** (good luck, family, love, home, etc.)?

8️⃣ What are the **key cultural symbols** of Bangladesh — animals, plants, patterns, or colors that carry special meaning?  
(I came across an idea that **a lizard is a guardian of the home** — is that true?)

9️⃣ Are there **traditional patterns, ornaments, or crafts** that often appear in food culture — like embroidery, textiles, or tableware?

1️⃣0️⃣ What’s the general **attitude toward food** — is it more about family, comfort, spirituality, street culture, or just the joy of flavor?

1️⃣1️⃣ What does a **daytime street food market** feel like — sounds, smells, colors, chaos? How would you describe the atmosphere?

1️⃣2️⃣ What does **hospitality** mean in Bangladeshi culture? Are there sayings, customs, or gestures tied to sharing food?

1️⃣3️⃣ Do you know any **restaurants, cafés, food trucks, or delivery places** that serve *real Bangladeshi food* outside Bangladesh — especially in Russia or Europe?

1️⃣4️⃣ If you’ve been there — **what dish or flavor stuck with you the most**, and why?

1️⃣5️⃣ And lastly — **what feeling do you associate with Bangladeshi food?**  
Is it comfort, heat, noise, family, chaos, or something else entirely?

Seeking tour guidance,"Salam All,

I am bringing my husband and MIL with me who have never visited Bangladesh and more likely this will be our only back home tour together. Therefore, trying to make most use of our time.

My goal is to visit Dhaka for a day, Khulna 2 days, Sylhet a few days and Cox-Bazar a few days then back to Dhaka for flight. My question is, is there a tour guide that can help me navigate going to all these different cities. Or can I hire driver from Dhaka airport to be with us till the end of the trip and go with to all these destinations. What will be most affordable way we all three can travel. Will domestic flights or car be a better option considering costs and time?

Horrible experience at Dhaka to Dubai flight with emirates,"I want to share an unpleasant experience my mother and I faced on our Emirates flight from Dhaka to the Dubai. What was supposed to be a smooth five-hour journey turned into a distressing experience because of one extremely rude and disrespectful passenger.

As soon as I boarded, I placed my two hand luggage bags in the overhead compartment. Immediately, a man started shouting at me, saying things like:

“Why are you putting your bag on my side? Where will I put mine?”

I calmly explained that there was enough space in the middle compartment and even offered to help him with his bag. Instead of accepting help, he continued yelling and refused to listen.

At first, I ignored his behaviour, but it quickly escalated. He aggressively removed my luggage from the compartment without my consent and shockingly began insulting my mother with disgusting, sexist language.

At that point, I stood up and confronted him — no one should ever tolerate such disrespect, especially towards women. Thankfully, the cabin crew and nearby passengers intervened before the situation got worse.

The Emirates crew handled the issue professionally and supported us throughout. We filed an official complaint so that the airline could keep a record of his behaviour for future flights.

This post isn’t just about one rude passenger — it’s about the bigger issue of misogyny, aggression, and lack of respect that too often goes unchecked, especially on routes from South Asia. As frequent flyers, my mother and I believe no one should have to endure such verbal abuse in a civilised setting.

I hope airlines continue to take stronger action to protect passengers — especially women — from harassment and verbal violence on flights Emirates",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1o0bqov/horrible_experience_at_dhaka_to_dubai_flight_with/,Former-Type1623,63,35,2025-10-07 17:09:50,bangladesh

I think I finally understand why Indians get so much hate and why many Bangladeshis dislike them,"Recently, I made a post in an Indian subreddit. I was simply asking:
“Hey, the saree is a shared cultural item among South Asian countries. But I always see India claiming it as Indian, not South Asian or from the Indian subcontinent. Why is that?”

I made that post because I’d seen a few videos where Indians were claiming Muslin as an Indian fabric.

For those who don’t know, Muslin is a fabric that originated in Dhaka. It’s extremely fine, almost see-through, and so delicate that an entire saree can pass through a ring.

So a in India a list was made of fabrics 
And muslin was there .



And I realized this isn't the first time or the first person who had done this 

Then I saw another post about saree being a purly indian garment 



Ok so in the comment section of my post 


Their logic was that since Bangladesh was founded in 1971, something thousands of years old couldn’t possibly belong to Bangladesh.

So I replied, “By that logic, nothing belongs to India either, since India was formed in 1947.”

That’s when they became enraged. They started saying things like “Bangladesh destroyed itself,” “it’s a failed state,” and other disrespectful comments. Many used very offensive language.

Basically, they don’t follow their own logic. To them, anything desi automatically belongs to India.

Before today, I used to think India wasn’t that bad, and that we all belonged to the same subcontinent. I didn’t understand the hate.

But now, I do.

Before this experience, I only knew a few Indians — my friends — and I mistakenly thought all Indians were like them.

Indians are just a bunch of entitled idiots (obviously there are some exceptions)

Help Needed: Retailer Not Returning IPS Battery Under Warranty,"Salaam everyone,

I’m looking for some advice, please.

About a year ago, I bought an IPS and battery package from a retailer on Nawabpur Road, Dhaka and had it delivered and installed in Sylhet.

Recently, the battery developed an issue, so we sent both the battery and IPS back under warranty. About a week ago, the retailer called to say the battery had been serviced and returned from the manufacturer, and that it would be delivered to Sylhet on Saturday or Sunday. Unfortunately, no delivery was made. Since then, they’ve stopped responding — they don’t reply on WhatsApp, they cancel calls, and I think they may have even blocked me.

I work abroad, so I can’t visit the shop myself. My relative called them, they initially spoke to him but now they cancel his calls.  I could ask someone to visit the shop on my behalf, but it would mean a long trip from Sylhet to Dhaka.

What are my options here? Has anyone experienced something similar, or can suggest the best way to deal with this? I’m worried they may just ignore us now and avoid delivering the product altogether.

What are some of the best places for Street Photography in Dhaka? (Excluding Sadarghat),"Recently, I've become immensely interested in documenting life through photography. I also bought an old pre-owned mirrorless camera to give this thing a spin. I'm an introverted person according to my friends and peers, but that's not something I'm willing to believe anymore. I believe I'm not born to confine myself within four walls. I want to be out there and shoot photos.  
  
So, fellow Bangladeshis, which place do you propose for street photography where I can put my creative endeavors into action? I would also appreciate if you could share some tips and tricks for this unique genre of photography.

HOW TO GET INDIAN MEDICAL VISA AT PRESENT [ Im frustrated😫 ],"Hello redditors, we plan to visit **Chennai Apollo Hospital** for my **sister's** medical treatment. As per the current rules for obtaining an Indian medical visa, an Ayush medical visa letter and the hospital's appointment letter are required. I have already arranged these documents and submitted the visa application to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka **twice** with all the necessary original documents.   
  
Another way to submit the application is through IVAC slots, but the Indian government has made these **slots very limited**, making it extremely difficult to secure one. My sister has been suffering from a severe skin infection on her chest for the **past four years**. We have tried all available treatments in Bangladesh, but the issue remains unresolved, which is why we are seeking an Indian medical visa. I have submitted the application to the Indian High Commission **twice and waited for two months**, but there has been no response. What can we do now to obtain the medical visa? I cannot bear to see my sister in this painful condition. 

I have heard that visa processing might become even more challenging for **Bangladeshis starting in 2025**. Is there anyone here who has recently obtained a medical visa? If so, could you please share how you managed to get it?

"No friends, loosing sanity","First of all, sorry if it sounds like not a major issue.

I'm 25M from a city other than Dhaka. I completed my undergrad. I have a job and I work remotely for past 2 years. I had friends back in my days. But slowly with the time, I kinda lost all of my friends. All of my friends are in different cities and some are not even in this country. I lost contact with some.

I don't have a girlfriend, and I never had one. Although there is this girl I chat daily (i know her irl), but recently some of her behaviors really got under my skin and I think I am done with that part and I do regret about that chapter. I wish I never started talking to her. 

I do go out on tours and meet my with friends whenever it's possible. But it's like once in a while.  

I earn decent. But now I am very empty inside. I feel sorry for me. I feel how miserable I am. On working days, it doesn't hunt me much. But I feel like crying on weekends. It's taking a toll on me. All I do is play video games, and browse social medias and random forums. But I cannot keep living like this. Every weekend I wanna go out and hangout with friends. But there's no one absolutely. And it's killing me inside. I'm losing my sanity. I just keep praying to get done with weekends as soon as possible. Is it a part of growing up? Is it just me or everyone else out there? Am I too weak? I am clueless, helpless and pissed. I don't even know how to express this thing. This is a very weird unpleasant sad feeling. I wish to cry sometimes and I don't even know how to cry. And I don't even know what to cry for. I don't know this weird super sad feeling.

"Dear Bangladeshi brothers, please take care not to harm us","I am an Indian Muslim, and Bengali - some of my ancestors came from Dhaka and Chittagong. 

I would beg all Bangladeshi Muslim brothers, to do everything in their power to protect the Hindu minority. I do not know what the actual situation is - and I know that our media has peddled a lot of lies, and tried to exaggerate the situation, invent a 'genocide', and so on. Yet, it is a fact that the population of Hindus has declined a lot due to exodus, and there are many legitimate concerns - like land-grabbing, and these occasional riots and disturbances, homes and businesses burnt, and so on. 

Any attack on Bengali Hindus, would be a blow to Indian Muslims. It would convince the Hindus here, that we are treacherous fanatics, waiting for our opportunity to persecute them. There is already a feeling that wherever Muslims become a majority, it is impossible for minorities to live among them. 

The reaction of such incidents is also borne by Bengali Muslims in India - in the form of mass detentions, arrests, eviction drives, and home demolitions (as are recently being seen in Assam).

Of course, beside this, it is the humanitarian and legal duty to maintain peace, and provide the fullest religious freedom to all Minorities. 

Durga Puja is almost here, I pray that it happen in perfect peace, proving the nobility of our Community and our sincere wish to live in Peace with the Hindus. Amen

So past few days i have been looking into ebike more specifically e scooty as i really dont mind the looks of a scooty and have found brands like revoo walton tailg
Among them only revoo has under 1lakh budget scooty
And the revoo A12s really caught my eyes
My questions are:
1. (To people who used ebikes) Is it better than riding with rickshaw?
2. What else brands and models are there in bangladesh 
3. The choices are pretty similar it seems when i compare to india with their more good looking ebikes. So is there any chance that we get ola or athers like brand in bangladesh.
4. (To people who have any type of bike) I sometimes take bike rides inside my residential area as they cost the same as rickshaw but they are much faster, so can i do ride-share with ebike

👉 Any Movie Halls, Drama Theatre or Recitation programs worth checking out?

👉 Do Book Clubs or Movie-watcher groups exist here? or is it just me dreaming like a lonely intellectual?

👉Nightlife? Is that even a thing in Narayanganj, or do people just go to bed early and let Dhaka have all the fun?

DUCSU 2025 - Analysis Of Shibir's Landslide Victory And Aftermath,"The DUCSU 2025 election took place on 9th September 2025, and the results are out. Shibir's landslide victory in the election surprised most people, and many are still struggling to accept it. This is just my personal analysis and observation of the election. To be frank, I am very much anti-Shibir ideologically, but I do congratulate them on their victory because this is how democracy should work. Perhaps I will garner downvotes from both sides, but putting that aside, here is an attempt to analyze the event and the aftermath objectively.

# Analysis

This was the first DUCSU election since 2019. Out of approximately 39,775 registered students, an impressive [\~75%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_DUCSU_election#Vice-President_election) cast their votes. Shibir won by a huge margin in the top three posts - Vice President, General Secretary, and Assistant General Secretary. Out of the remaining 12 posts in the central committee, [Shibir won 9 seats](https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/7shgm6t3ll), and independent candidates won 3 seats. Out of the 15 seats in the central committee, there are 13 more seats. Shibir won in 11 of them, 1 was won by an independent candidate, and the other by a leftist candidate.

[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2025\_DUCSU\_election#Vice-President\_election](https://preview.redd.it/8dp92i0doeof1.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=662a72bb59b9d70e00946f92c0931b44c7b8d3c7)

Initially, many candidates like [Abid](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/ddaaksu-nirbaacn-kaarcupir-abhiyog-aabidsh-dui-praarthiir) from Chatra Dal, [Umama](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/yr9ll5lv3u), Meghmallar, and [Abdul Kader](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/798953r10n), called the election a fraud and denounced it. It should be noted that there were indeed several issues, discrepancies, and mishaps during the election. But it seems these were in the minority, and it is [unlikely to have impacted the election results significantly](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/jtegu85p55). It is [not rational](https://www.facebook.com/kallol.mustafa/posts/pfbid0BhqJRAfxujZ42gZbM7pXvCdakaD79z66ciw1dga2sPTTfaWfrT8wA7UycX9L6paml) to make claims of election engineering without strong evidence. However, controversies in JUCSU and [such claims](https://www.facebook.com/kazijesinbd/posts/pfbid035hT9mSugPNNK7rDh9yfQjdFn5b3Q1v8SEgAYrrzmxYwP5Wj3UqTQm1LswemrJtQbl) do have some merit and perhaps we should also attempt to find out the answer to [these questions](https://www.facebook.com/meghmallar.bosu/posts/pfbid02tv7bpyJAYRWTJRp2znJNh9iM9ycFLU51ZzFzTCKSyfRpK12An8HthGEnQif964Yrl).

But it seems likely that it was a fair election which Shibir won. This leads us to the next point - understanding how that outcome came about. As I said, I am ideologically strongly anti-Shibir, but to counter their ideology, we need to understand the problem and how it happened first. Below, I outline and rank these factors in order of importance.

**Clean Positive Image, Welfare-based Politics, And Humility**

As surprising as it might sound, this seems to be the [biggest reason](https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/g9wby5oaqm) to me. The Shibir candidates have a strong positive image on campus. Shadik Kayem, who became the VP, is also one of the leaders of the July Movement. Shibir also actively did welfare-based politics - helped poor students, organized career training and programs, various social welfare, and [innovative ideas](https://www.facebook.com/saerzulkarnain/posts/pfbid0Yeo87r6h2Fh2eTgbsX69ww1hUptMSsdvmo9F8MwqBthZb78VLK5YdniysPCraK6yl). Chatra Dal and the leftist organizations fall behind significantly on these aspects, at least when considering scale and dedication.

Shibir were humble and genuine throughout the campaign and even [after victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMmbVbQaDFA). People do not like arrogance and attitude, especially after a mass uprising. You can question their intent and ideology all you want, but there is no doubt that this is the perception they were able to create with their actions.

**Frustration With Other Political Parties And Weak Opposition**

Chatra Dal is stupid, frankly speaking, and does not have their priorities right. It is quite easy to see through their superficial acts and rhetoric. NCP is very controversial, divided, and arrogant. If NCP were not so controversial and divided, it could have participated in the election united and also would have garnered tons of votes from the swing voters. The independent candidates were good, which is why they won 5 seats and got many votes, but they also don't have the political strength and backing. Therefore, many students were unsure and could not rely on their promises and how much they would be able to deliver, despite their goodwill.

As for the leftists, it's a bit different. When there is an injustice, leftist organizations are usually the first to take a stand against it, and this is great. But what about the common daily struggles of the students? Imagine a poor student outside of Dhaka struggling. He/she finds solace when Shibir bonds with them, shares spiritual stuff, helps them with career development, provides food, etc. What do the leftist parties do? Leftist parties mean well and promise changes, but in practice, they fall short in terms of delivering them to the common students via structured campaigns and activities. Left-aligned individuals are nice and often help others, but this gets associated mostly on a personal level and not with an ideology/party. Whereas in the case of Shibir, the party benefits because of its structure and strategy. The leftist parties do have their limitations despite good intentions. For example, they do not have much funding. On the other hand, Shibir is very organized and has access to large funds from various sources.

**Organization Structure And Campaign Strategy**

Shibir is methodical, organized, united by a common ideology, and recruits/grooms meritorious students from an early age. They have been preparing for DUCSU for more than a year. Their door-to-door campaign and interaction with students were nothing short of remarkable. While others were busy playing checkers, they played chess. It's a long-term game, and they were very focused on their goals and pursued them methodically.

**Social Acceptance**

The two biggest criticisms of Shibir are being anti-1971 and being extremists. They [still are](https://www.shibir.org.bd/center/uploaded/CONSTITUTION%20book_Final_2024.pdf) in many ways, but they have managed to convince a large part of their members and supporters, and also the swing voters otherwise. As for 1971, they never disown or condemn the roles of their predecessors but diplomatically pay tribute to the freedom fighters and the liberation war. It is very questionable and ambiguous at best, but combine that with the rise of anti-1971 propaganda (not necessarily from Shibir) and how BAL used, distorted, and sold 1971 to justify their crimes, Shibir succeeded in creating an illusory image that the present generation of Shibir is not anti-1971 and should not have to bear the crimes of their ancestors.

As for extremism, they have managed to trick others with deception and manipulation. They have many intellectuals like Mirza Ghalib who are not extremists in the traditional sense and often justify their fundamentalism and problematic policies with diplomacy and word salad. With the intellectuals and social media activists, they were able to portray themselves as liberal democrats with a mix of religious/ethical dedication in the eyes of many.

**Vote Splits**

I would have ranked it much higher had Shibir not won by a huge margin. Notice that a significant portion of the people still voted against Shibir. For the [VP post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_DUCSU_election#Vice-President_election), there were four other good candidates, and the votes were split across them.

**Rise Of Fundamentalism**

No doubt that fundamentalism and right-wing politics have risen in Bangladesh. There are many reasons for this, not diving deep here for now. It is important to note that many Islamic parties and right-wing individuals are strongly against Shibir. But nonetheless, a significant part sympathizes with Shibir. And due to their somewhat aligned goals and hatred for liberal democracy and leftists, it is likely they voted for Shibir.

**Victimhood**

Shibir was oppressed by BAL for years. BAL also normalized attacking or even killing people by tagging them as ""Shibir"". For example, the murder of Abrar Fahad. It didn't matter if they did Shibir or not. When you oppress a group like this, you end up making them victims and martyrs. And naturally, people sympathize with them.

**Liberal Hypocrisy And Elitism**

When liberals remain silent as Hefazot is massacred in Shapla in 2013, when liberals blockade Shahbagh for weeks, and instead of demanding a fair and impartial trial, deliver the sentence themselves while chanting hateful and violent slogans, when liberals enable BAL's atrocities just because they believe there is a greater evil. When some liberals resort to [hateful acts](https://www.facebook.com/faisalxahmed01/posts/pfbid02QtrDVdh4hxxowJNNBJZ4MKp6NGRSY5q75FBw3EcdGaGT5S87ARd32dNN5kUS2ge2l), and the others are silent (is it much different from some fundamentalists doing hateful acts and moderates staying silent?). Do all these create a positive or negative branding about their values and ideologies? Heck, it does not matter how correct your ideologies or values are if your actions are like this.

Is there a difference between ""kanke mage hejab koi???"" and ""Look at those brainless Hijabi KFC chickens simping over Shibir""? Is the difference a matter of ideology or mentality? Hatred only brews more hatred, and before you know it, you end up becoming the monster you started to fight yourself. There is a difference between being strong and being a bigot. You could strongly make the point why you think the Hijab is a symbol of modesty and should be preferred, but not imposed. Or you could strongly make the point why you believe that the Hijab is a symbol of oppression due to how it is enforced and how women are conditioned. Instead of doing that, what are you achieving with hate? Do you want to see the world burning, or do you want to influence and change others to follow your values? Even if you are right rationally, what does it tell others about your values if your actions are hateful? Will you influence others or push them away?

And no, it is not being diplomatic or always taking a non-binary stance. Some things **are binary**. If someone is against democracy, against human rights, you don't excuse that by taking a non-binary position. You stand against them firmly and fight it. You just don't have to become like them in the process.

All these things act like slow poisoning. It pushes people away. If a swing voter were considering voting for you, they would be repelled, and then they must choose between the lesser evil. Perhaps they agree with you on how the other side is so bad, but you pissed them off so bad with your elitism and hypocrisy that they would rather vote for the bad guys than you. This is literally [one of the biggest reasons](https://www.paulgraham.com/woke.html) why someone like Trump is in power in the US.

# If Shibir Is So Good, Why Don't You...

That's a lovely question. Dr Zahed explains it much better than I can ever [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c113p8ewMUw). I also shared my reasoning earlier [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1nauanz/%E0%A6%A1%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B8_%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%AC_%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AF_%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%9A%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%9B%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%B0_%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95_%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%9F_%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%AF_%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%A3/). Shibir's politics is [identity politics](https://annas-archive.org/md5/15a5c6b4cc7c7b0ab75c99c9a3ae29c0), which always excludes instead of including everyone. BJP and Hindutva, Trump's white supremacism, Israel's Zionism, Jamaat's Islamism are all the same. History teaches us that nothing good ever comes out of it, no matter how charming they might seem initially.

They have the following in their constitution. They leave it purposefully vague so that when someone confronts them and questions how their goals are anti-democratic, they can twist their argument with word salad and mental gymnastics and argue how it's not. But one only has to look at the mainstream interpretations and wonder why they have so many details in their booklets, but they never specify how exactly democracy and democratic values will work in their system. They never clarify their interpretation of the religion and how they will use it to rule the country. It's bits and pieces to lure people with deception and manipulate them to gain their support. Hypocrisy and ambiguity everywhere, the perfect example of a wolf in sheep's clothing.



[https:\/\/www.shibir.org.bd\/center\/uploaded\/CONSTITUTION&amp;#37;20book\_Final\_2024.pdf \(Page 10\)](https://preview.redd.it/a1cspuwavlof1.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a964bf51858b76c154b673df74ffcd08d1e606)

They are against democracy, [against equal rights of men and women](https://youtu.be/LVONB0hdr0o?t=2710), and many universally accepted human rights. They seek to impose their perceived version of an Islamic Sharia, even though [most Islamic parties strongly oppose Jamaat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioXBubjsSao) in terms of ideology. They are a political party in a democratic system that seeks to come to power with democracy and trickery, and when they do come to power, they will destroy the very same democratic values themselves.

Jamaat supporters and sympathizers, does it sound absurd to some? Or is that what you want as well? Are you an extremist or just brainwashed? Don't believe me? Well, it's right in their damn [booklets](https://www.shibir.org.bd/center/uploaded/kormo_proddhoti.pdf) and [constitution](https://www.shibir.org.bd/center/uploaded/CONSTITUTION%20book_Final_2024.pdf). It's a dangerous philosophy and a recipe for disaster.

# Aftermath

While this won't significantly impact the upcoming election, it is likely to have a long-term domino effect and end up in one of two ways. While the BNP still appears likely to win the upcoming election, the contest will be far more competitive than many expected. In the longer term, however, the real test will be whether the leftists, liberals, and centrists can reform and rebuild their politics. BNP will also need to do the same. If this possibility happens, then there is a silver lining, and we have a chance.

The other possibility, which is also more likely, is that nobody learns anything, and this begins the first step towards us moving backwards. Right-wing parties and fundamentalist groups could re-emerge with renewed confidence. gaining political traction. Moral policing and harassment will increase. Over time, this trajectory could pave the way for a party like Jamaat to ascend to power. It wouldn’t necessarily mirror Afghanistan, but the state of human rights, especially for women and minorities, would deteriorate sharply. Economic growth would be stunted, international relations and trade would suffer, and the country could spiral toward anarchy, civil conflict, or even foreign intervention.

The fundamentalists and extremists are already delighted by this result, and they did not wait for long to start the shitshow - [Example 1](https://www.facebook.com/Anik0000/posts/pfbid02KyNgH6THnmgCHwozXBnwW49GEYCC1UaWnkr1dsdbd9WnsEsA9TF4VVSkboHXVUwBl), [Example 2](https://www.facebook.com/Anik0000/posts/pfbid02ur4gw68qA89dv5mdcM8WvxCjjMAMqSJCZPedvXatYGvw11FEGP5TM8tAZjpKjo6nl), [Example 3](https://www.facebook.com/arunimatahsin/posts/pfbid0ZRuAenSiH48G8UbUCNfCx67x6vxVPQfps2z5wrUSfvwKmGoTwCBcg7ptxQbHXBL6l), [Example 4](https://www.facebook.com/Anik0000/posts/pfbid02aCg9ZtdFKNcxNGFGYKzLsuit5advcCeJnPm2pPNnm4ej941ZjhJnbcWwNsuvnwpLl), [Example 5](https://www.facebook.com/parvezalambd/posts/pfbid02KcjVVZAnVGNDyoASjaLKAUcQhh3Eo3mcsKzuga6JmJ9d7daJcyVZsc9ko8Cb5DaUl). The rest will follow eventually.

Why am I doing this? In our religion we are encouraged to help people in need. zakat is there for a reason. I might have donated in an organisation but in most cases lion share of my donation would have been spent against overhead costs (salaries/office expenses etc) instead of the truly deserving candidate themselves. I could have paid Zakat to finance a person who wants to start a business but in this world chances of being duped is higher with education expense the loss would be lower than trying to finance a business.

Back story: Its my dream to be an engineer. as all we know in bangladesh, we have to take science for it. I took my SSC in science group and got A-. Took science in college too. Its a cantonment college btw. Maximum student failed on the final exam. Then the college make some exceptions for avarage students and took retake for the bad students, again maximum failed. But i was in the exception group. College gave use condition, after a 1.5 week there will be a CT (CLASS TEST) on 30 marks. Students have to pass 4 sub least. Also the principle added they will add extra class, after the college hours ends we can pick teacher who will take class on their subjects.
Many days pass we didn't got the extra class but 2 teacher came forword and started the extra class with their own willpower. We only got 4 extra bio class and 2 extra chemistry class. At the time we were middel of the exam. Our result came i got 5 F and 2 pass. Many of my friends quickly Take TC and started their new college without the year gap.
Btw In that college after this months ends the Pre-Test will start and their will be more student fall. Whats the point if they plan to cut off some student after CT if they want to cut now. 
There is a huge resons why the college is doing this. For the new 1st year students the college incresed the seat number from dhaka board but there is no space for the extended seats they issued. We have 3 science sections  the day after the result the college combined 3 science section to 1 science section for the 2nd year. Left 2 free room for 1st year (newcome). Sometimes I wonder politics should learn politics from that college.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1ndp06h/can_i_study_bsc_in_computer_science_in_australia/,ArthurXP002,5,2,2025-09-11 02:13:35,bangladesh

Why do our national subreddits have such low member counts?,"This r/Bangladesh sub has about 84K members and r/Dhaka has 137K. Our country has 180 million people but our membership counts are extremely low.

I was just checking out r/Nepal and despite their population being 29 million, their subreddit's membership were almost 200k+

Meanwhile a Bangladeshi NSFW subreddit have more members (124k) than this sub.

What if Sam Hargrave's Extraction had a Bangladeshi cast,"So stunt man turned director Sam Hargrave made a film called Extraction. It was based on a book called Ciudad (City in Spanish) as the setting was South American and therefore all the Asians in Extraction were based on South Americans.

However for reason I cant find answers to. Sam decided to have the setting be Bangladesh, a South Asian Muslim majority country. He even hired Bangladeshi filmmaker Raffael Ahsan to translate the Bengali parts of the script to keep the language accurate too. The film was originally named Dhaka and was going to be entirely set in Bangladesh (minus Chris Hemsworth Australian scenes)

However things fall apart when Ahsan found the cast were non-Bangladeshi and couldnt learn the language well enough. Casting director Sarah Halley Finn and Sam Hargrave denied Ahsans request to find Bangladeshi actors on the idea that none are famous enough to garner attention for the film. Add in the fact an Indian Producer was brought on and apparently made more changes possibly Saju and Ovi being Indian Hindus instead of Bangladeshi Muslims. It had lead to accusations of Islamophobia within the film purposely using Bangladesh as a Muslim country of faceless canon fodder.

But it got me thinking. What if Sam Hargrave took up Raffael Ahsan's suggestion? What if he decided to do what Gareth Evans did for Indonesia with the Raid and cast talented actor with ancestry from the country it was set? What Extraction was the Bangladeshi Raid?

Well this is what Ive come up with if Extraction had a Bangladeshi led cast and still called Dhaka. Most of the characters would likely be renamed to fit the Bangladeshi actors heritage

Dana Abraham Hannan as Tyler Rake. Dana is a 6'2"" Dhaka born Canadian actor with n amateur boxing background. I chose him for his muscular build, tattoos and martial arts experience that would make him essentially resemble an Asian Chris Hemsworth. Id rename the character Tariq Rahim.

Aydin Ahmed as Ovi. Aydin is a British Bangladeshi child actor best known as Kevin Chipman in Deadpool and Wolverine. I felt that Ovi, his dad and Saju should be from Sylhet, Bangladesh instead of India. So British Bangladeshis would make sense for them as most British Bangladeshis are Sylheti. Aydin's dad Ifte Amed could easily play Ovi's Dad in the short prison scene Saju. Id rename the character Ali.

Jan Uddin as Saju. Jan is also a British Bangladeshi actor. With his fit build, long hair and 6'1"" stature. Id say he matches Randeep Hooda look. Jan was in Marvel Agents of Sheild as Isaiah and was Asimov Solensa in Cowboy Bebop. So he has some action experience. Sarah Finn Halley should be aware of him too as she regularly casts Marvel projects so how she didnt cast him for Extraction when he was in a Marvel show around the time he film was in preproduction is beyond me. Id rename the character Sajjid (tho Saj or Saju would be realistic nickname for a Sajjid)

Farzana Due Elah as Nik Khan. Its not confirmed if Nik Khan is Bangladeshi. Her name which Im assuming is Anika ""Nik"" Khan wouldnt be out of place for a Bangladeshi. The sequel reveals she is French Bangladeshi which is not as common as British Bangladeshis or Italian Bangladeshis. But this is due to her original actress being French Iranian. I ld love to see if British Bangladeshi Farzana Dua Elahe could play an action girl role. She was in Our Girl as a Bangladeshi too. This characters name would be the same

Islah Abdur Rahman as Yaz Khan. Yaz is Niks younger brother. He is a cameo at beat in the first film but more important in the second. Tho his actor is French Tunisian (thus making Nik and Yaz French Bangladeshis presumably), this versiom would British Bangladeshi like Islah Abdur Rahman. Rahman has experience in HwarangDo which would be great for Yaz Khans fight scenes, tho he onoy really had one in the sequel and almost died to a large mercenary woman after killing 2 of her men. Im assuming Yaz's full name is Yaseen ""Yaz"" Khan.

Char Avell as Gaspar. For some reason Tylers only friend living in Dhaka is a massive American named Gaspar (Im assuming he is married to a Bangladeshi woman as he mentions a wife but she isnt seen so who knows). But I chose Char Avell as Gaspar as the singer is 6'3"" making him slightly taller than Dana (same way David Harbour is taller than Chris Hemsworth). It would mean this version of Gaspar would be a British Bangladeshi who has moved to Dhaka. Char has some acting experience from web series and once with the BBC series Coconut. But I can definitely see him do a short role like this. Gaspar would be renamed Ghazan.

Taskeen Rahman as Asif Amir. Taskeen is a Bangladeshi actor (who he has lived in Australia quite a lot). Taskeen get typecast in Bangladesh for villain roles a lot due to his Blue Eyes. In Bangladesh light coloured eyes are called Shada Soke (White Eyes) and are seen as creepy or souless. Which is likely why Taskeen gets villain roles a lot.

Mahi Alam as Farhad. Mahi is a Bangladeshi American singer and actor best known for American Born Chinese as Anuj and the Mean Girl remake as Kevin Ganatra. So this would be the first time having him play a Bangladeshi.

Saikat Ahamed as Colonel Sadik. Saikat Ahamed is a British Bangladeshi actor. I mostly chose him due to his age as Sadik is a older man and spends most of his action scenes Sniping. So Saikat can get into good shape for it. But doesnt need to be a crazy hand to hand fighter for this kinda role. Plus the head shot of him looks like he can pull off an aged and serious military man.

In addition to having Bangladeshis in the cast the plot will revolve around a corrupt goverment official from Dhaka (the original plan was Asif Amir is from a government family but Ahsan felt that was too contriversal tho recent events in Desh shows this to be accruate) will kidnapped the child of a Sylheti crime KingPin so that a Bangladeshi Canadian mercenary is sent in due to his firmiliarity to the city and its language. 

If I could also add one more thing. Id get Grandmaster Mak Yuree to be the cultural advisor to the action scenes so that the Bangladeshis would be using the Bangladeshi martial art Butthan for the film same was The Raid had Indonesians using Pencakt Silat for that film just to show Bangladeshi Martial Arts in a big budget action film.

Backpacking Bangladesh,"Yo! 

I’ve been backpacking around Asia since February and thinking my next destination will be Bangladesh. 

For some context, 25 years old male, I’m half Bengali, half Scottish and grew up in England. I lived in Sylhet for 3 years when I was younger, so I’m kinda proficient in Bangla and familiar with culture/religion etc. 

I wanna go around Dhaka, Sylhet, see some nature up north and maybe even Sundarbans. I was thinking fly to Dhaka, travel up north to Sylhet etc and then fly down south if I feel like it. 

Would love to hear some cool things to do as I would also like to vlog my experience and show the world how beautiful Bangladesh really is. I’m really interested in learning more about our history and how that has shaped our community.

Open to suggestions and invitations to any groups etc! 

All the best 🇧🇩

ডাকসু এবং অন্যান্য নির্বাচনে ছাত্র শিবিরকে ভোট দিবেন যে কারণে,"ডাকসু এবং অন্যান্য বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ে ছাত্র সংসদ নির্বাচন আসন্ন। অনেকদিন পরে একটি ভালো নির্বাচন হচ্ছে, যার জন্য অনেক আলোচনা হচ্ছে। এবং এর প্রভাব হয়তো কিছুটা আসন্ন জাতীয় নির্বাচন এবং ভবিষ্যৎ রাজনীতিতেও পড়বে। বিভিন্ন দল এবং অনেক স্বতন্ত্র ভালো ভালো প্রার্থী আছেন, তবে আজকে আমরা আলোচনা করবো শিবিরকে নিয়ে এবং কেন তাদেরকে ভোট দিবেন।

ইসলামী ছাত্রশিবির বাংলাদেশের একটি বিতর্কিত ছাত্রসংগঠন, যা জামায়াতে ইসলামী দলের ছাত্রশাখা হিসেবে পরিচিত। এই সংগঠনটি ১৯৭৭ সালে প্রতিষ্ঠিত হয়। তবে এর মূল শিকড় ১৯৭১ সালের মুক্তিযুদ্ধের সময়কার [আলবদর ও আলশামস বাহিনীর সঙ্গে জড়িত](https://sanipanhwar.com/uploads/books/2024-08-28_11-14-22_e7e618749123a45a175568c842f1a180.pdf) (পৃষ্ঠা ৭৩-৭৪), তখন এর নাম ছিল পূর্ব পাকিস্তান ইসলামী ছাত্র সংঘ। মুক্তিযুদ্ধের সময় তারা পাকিস্তানি সেনাদের সহযোগী হিসেবে স্বাধীনতাকামী মুক্তিকামী মানুষদের হত্যা, নির্যাতন ও ধর্ষণের মতো নৃশংস অপরাধে অংশ নিয়েছিল। তারা বুদ্ধিজীবী হত্যাকাণ্ডেও [সরাসরি জড়িত](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1heudhm/comment/m28kd4p/) ছিল।

এখন প্রশ্ন উঠতে পারে ৫০ বছর আগের ঘটনা এখন কীভাবে প্রাসঙ্গিক। যেখানে শিবিরের নেতা এবং জামায়াতেরও অনেক নেতার ১৯৭১ সালে জন্মও হয় নাই। প্রাসঙ্গিক এই কারণে যে আদর্শগত যে কারণে তারা তখন মুক্তিযুদ্ধের বিরোধিতা করেছিল এবং যুদ্ধাপরাধ করেছিল, সেই আদর্শগত কারণ পরিবর্তন হয় নাই। হয় নাই দেখেই তারা তখন তৎকালীন সংগঠনের ভূমিকা প্রত্যাখ্যান করে না, বরং সাফাই গায়। হয় নাই দেখেই তারা যুদ্ধাপরাধীদের বিচারের দাবি উঠায় না, বরং ঢাবিতে [২৪ এর নামে রাজাকারদের ছবি টানায়](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/npff9g22kv)। আর তাছাড়া যেখানে ১৯৭১ সালে [ঢাবিতে তারা নৃশংস গণহত্যা](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Dhaka_University_massacre) করেছে, সেখানে তারা তাদের কৃতকর্মের ফল ভোগ না করে এবং প্রায়শ্চিত্ত না করে নির্বাচনে জিতলে শহীদদের রক্তের সাথেই গাদ্দারি করা হবে। ছাত্রলীগের যে ভয়াবহ অপকর্ম এবং ২৪ সালেও এরা যা করেছে, ১৯৭১ সালে শিবিরের ভয়াবহতা এর থেকেও অনেকগুণ বেশি ছিল। এই কথা বলে ছাত্রলীগের দায়মুক্তির চেষ্টা হচ্ছে না, তবে এখন যদি ৫০ বছর পরে ছাত্রলীগ বকরীলীগ নামে ফেরত আসে এবং ভোট চায়, আপনি কি ভোট দিবেন যদি তাদের মধ্যে ন্যূনতম অনুশোচনা এবং পরিবর্তনও না থাকে? একই যুক্তি কি এখানেও খাটে না? অতীতের দায়মোচন না করে যারা সামনে আগাতে চায়, তাদের ভরসা করা কতটুকু যৌক্তিক আর নৈতিক?

আচ্ছা, এবার মুক্তিযুদ্ধ বাদ দিলাম। অন্য প্রসঙ্গে বলি। ইসলামী ছাত্রশিবির নিজেদেরকে একটি ইসলামী আদর্শভিত্তিক ছাত্রসংগঠন দাবি করলেও তাদের কার্যক্রমের মধ্য দিয়ে প্রায়ই চরমপন্থী ও উগ্র রাজনৈতিক প্রবণতা স্পষ্ট হয়েছে। সংগঠনটির [ঘোষিত উদ্দেশ্য](https://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/publication/file/185_constitution_Jan_2020.pdf) হচ্ছে ইসলামী সমাজব্যবস্থা প্রতিষ্ঠা করা। এই লক্ষ্য বাংলাদেশের সংবিধানপ্রদত্ত ধর্মনিরপেক্ষ ও গণতান্ত্রিক চরিত্রের সঙ্গে সাংঘর্ষিক। লক্ষ্য অর্জনের জন্য তারা ছাত্র সমাজকে প্রভাবিত করতে চায়। যার জন্য তারা স্কুল থেকেই তাদের কার্যক্রম শুরু করে এবং বিভিন্নভাবে প্রভাব খাটিয়ে কোমলমতি শিক্ষার্থীদের তাদের আদর্শে আনতে চেষ্টা করে, যা কিনা অনৈতিক কারণ এটা অনেকটা মগজধোলাই। এবং তারা এটা করে ধর্মের নামে, যেহেতু তারা ধর্মভিত্তিক পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি করে যা কিনা গণতন্ত্রের জন্য বিপজ্জনক। জামায়াতের আদর্শ মওদুদীবাদের বিপদ সম্পর্কেও [এখান](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBagqYrn9tg) থেকে আরো জেনে নিতে পারেন এবং কেন অনেক ইসলামী দল এবং আলেম এর বিরোধিতা করেন।

ধর্মভিত্তিক পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি শুধু সংখ্যালঘু নয়, বাকিদের জন্যও বিপজ্জনক। বিশ্বের বিভিন্ন দেশে দেখা গেছে, যখন ধর্ম বা জাতিগত পরিচয়ের ভিত্তিতে রাজনীতি জোরদার হয়, তখন সহিংসতা ও গৃহদ্বন্দ্ব বেড়ে যায়। যেমন ভারত এবং বিজেপি সরকার এর একটি বড় উদাহরণ। পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি সমাজকে একত্রিত না করে বরং খণ্ডিত করে। আর এখানে যখন ধর্মের বিভিন্ন ব্যাখ্যা আছে, তখন বিষয়টি আরো বিপজ্জনক হয়ে যায় যা কিনা অসহিষ্ণুতা বাড়িয়ে দেয়। যদি উদাহরণ দেই, ধরেন আপনি ধার্মিক এবং হিজাব করেন। আপনি নাও করতে পারেন এবং দুই ক্ষেত্রেই সেটা আপনার ব্যক্তিগত মত এবং অধিকার। তবে ধর্মভিত্তিক এসব দল ক্ষমতায় আসলে আপনার তাদের ব্যাখ্যা এবং মন মতই পর্দা করতে হবে। এই অসহিষ্ণুতা এবং জোর খাটানোর প্রবণতাই সব থেকে বিপজ্জনক।

আর খেয়াল করে দেখবেন যে শিবির ধারাবাহিকভাবে মুনাফেকি রাজনীতি করে। তাদের গঠনতন্ত্রে নারী নেতৃত্ব নিষিদ্ধ, তাদের নারী কর্মীদেরও নেকাব করা বাধ্যতামূলক কিন্তু ডাকসুর প্রার্থী হিসেবে তারা এমন কিছু নারীকে দিয়েছে যাদের জন্য আবার এমনটি প্রযোজ্য নয়। এই দ্বিমুখী আচরণের যৌক্তিক ব্যাখ্যা কি? বিপরীতমুখী হয়ে গেল না? তারা যদি সত্যিই পরিবর্তন আর আধুনিক হত, তবে কি দ্বিমুখী আচরণ করতো? প্রকৃতপক্ষে এটা আসলে ধোঁকা ছাড়া আর কিছুই না। গুপ্ত এবং মুনাফেকি রাজনীতি করবে, সুবিধা নিবে কিন্তু কোন দায় নিবে না। যেমন কয়েকদিন আগে তাদের একজন কর্মী [গণধর্ষণের হুমকি](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/29czmjum2o) দিল, কিন্তু আলোচনায় আসলে গুপ্ত রাজনীতির সুবিধা হিসেবে দল হিসেবে কোন দায়ই নিল না। আর অনলাইনে ধারাবাহিকভাবে নারী হেনস্তা এবং যে কোন সমালোচনার [হেনস্তা](https://www.facebook.com/abdul.qader.790007/posts/pfbid01JSoFFZeUBSiiRCDaCvKZGvvssu3X3C1GjvUHguefgSKwW5gEsHL7ZF9F6fFQ3Yal) তারা করেই যাচ্ছে ক্রমাগত।

আর সবশেষে যে বিষয়ে বলবো তা হচ্ছে শিবির কি বাকি ছাত্র সংঘটনগুলোর থেকে আলাদা? এর উত্তর হচ্ছে হ্যাঁ এবং না দুটোই। শিবিরের আদর্শ এবং গঠনতন্ত্র অনেক আলাদা বাকি সংঘটনগুলোর থেকে। শিবির অনেক বেশি সংগঠিত এবং এরা প্রচুর মেধাবী শিক্ষার্থীও আকৃষ্ট করে। কিন্তু একটা কথা বুঝতে হবে যে মূর্খ শয়তানের থেকে শিক্ষিত শয়তান বেশি খারাপ। শিবিরের অনেক কর্মী এবং নেতা ব্যক্তি হিসেবে ভালো, দেশের ভালোও চায়, কিন্তু যখন দলগত এবং আদর্শগত এত সমস্যা থাকে, তখন সমষ্টিগতভাবে সাধারণত সেটা ভালো কিছু বয়ে আনে না। গত ১৬ বছর তারা লীগ দ্বারা অত্যাচারিত হয়েছে, তাই জেন জির অনেকেই হয়তো শিবিরের ইতিহাস সম্পর্কে জানে না। তখন এখনকার মত সোশ্যাল মিডিয়াও ছিল না তাই এই বিষয়ে তথ্য প্রমাণও কম। তার পরেও পুরনো পত্রিকা এবং সেই সময়কার আলোচকদের সাথে কথা বললে অনেক কিছুই জানবেন। এই বিষয়ে আর বেশি কিছু বলছি না তবে কারো আগ্রহ থাকলে তাসনীম খলিলের [এই](https://www.facebook.com/tasneem.khalil/posts/%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%97-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF-%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%93-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%93%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%87-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9F%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%95/10170443322455319/) পোস্ট, এবং [এই](https://www.facebook.com/tasneem.khalil/posts/%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%97-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8-%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%AB%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%82-%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%95-%E0%A7%A7%E0%A7%AF%E0%A7%AD%E0%A7%A7-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%9B%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%98-%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%80-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9B%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%B9/10170448123495319/) পোস্ট দেখে নিতে পারেন। পোস্টের নিচেও অনেক মন্তব্য আর প্রমাণ আছে। শিবির যেসব ক্যাম্পাসের নিয়ন্ত্রণ পেয়েছিল (যেমন চবি), সেগুলোর সাংস্কৃতিক এবং সবকিছুর পরিবর্তনও একটু ঘাটলেই জানতে পারবেন। সেখানে তাদের নিয়ন্ত্রণ এবং সহিংসতা কেমন ছিল নিয়ন্ত্রণ নেওয়ার পরে একটু জেনে দেখবেন খোঁজ করে। এবং এটা মোটেও শুধু তাদের অতীত চরিত্র নয়, [বর্তমানেও](https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/district/2ybmze1yxc) খুব বেশি পরিবর্তন হয় নাই। এরকম ভাবার কোন যৌক্তিক কারণ নেই যে অন্য দলগুলোর তুলনায় শিবির গেস্টরুম এবং সহিংসতার চর্চায় ভালো কোন নজির স্থাপন করবে।

তাহলে আপনি ছাত্র শিবিরকে কখন এবং কেন ভোট দিবেন? সরলীকরণ করি একটু। নিম্নের যে কোন একটি সত্যি হলে ভোট দিন তাদের।

* আপনি ১৯৭১ এবং মুক্তিযুদ্ধবিরোধী।
* শহীদদের রক্তের সাথে বেঈমানি করতে আপনার খারাপ লাগে না। কারণ আপনি মনে করেন সেটা ৫০ বছর আগের কথা এবং শিবিরের এখন অনেক পরিবর্তন হয়েছে।
* আপনি উগ্র ধর্মীয় মতবাদে বিশ্বাসী, অগণতান্ত্রিক পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি পছন্দ করেন, সংখ্যালঘু এবং নারীর অধিকার চান না।
* আপনি তথাকথিত মূলধারার রাজনীতি নিয়ে চরম বিরক্ত। আপনি পরিবর্তন চান খুব করে। কিন্তু আপনার মাথায় বাস্তবতা নেই এবং এটা বুঝতে চান না যে পরিবর্তন শুধু ভালোর দিকে না, খারাপের দিকেও যেতে পারে। ঢিমেতালে আগালেও গণতান্ত্রিকভাবে দেশ এগিয়েছে এত দিন। আপনি মূলধারার রাজনৈতিক দলগুলোকে মধ্যাঙ্গুলি দেখানোর দিকে এতই মনোযোগী যে সেই বাস্তবতা অথবা ঝুঁকি বোঝার মত ক্ষমতা অথবা ইচ্ছা আপনার কোনটাই নেই। সহজ করে বললে আপনার মনটা ভালোই কিন্তু বোকার স্বর্গে বাস করেন।

তো প্রিয় ছোট ভাই বোনেরা, জেন জি এবং তারুণ্যের নাম আর ডুবাবেন না। আপনারা পড়াশোনা জানা মানুষ, একটু ভাবেন। আর দিন শেষে ভাবনা চিন্তা করে যেটা ভালো মনে হয় করেন। যদি অযৌক্তিক কিছু বলে থাকি সেটা আলোচনা করেন। আর নাহলে এমন কাউকে নির্বাচিত করবেন না যার জন্য আপনার এবং জাতিকেও ভবিষ্যতে খেসারত দিতে হয়।

ব্যক্তিগত মত তুলে ধরেছি কিন্তু চেষ্টা করেছি নিরপেক্ষভাবে তথ্য প্রমাণ তুলে ধরেই বলার। ইচ্ছা হলে যে কোন অংশ কপি পেস্ট করে পোস্ট করতে পারেন, ক্রেডিট দেওয়ার দরকার নাই।

Need advice: finding it hard to deal with my mindset about women,"I’m a 21M, studying in a private university in Dhaka. I’ve always gone to all-boys schools/colleges, so I never really had the chance to interact much with girls. Growing up, I saw my friends with girlfriends, spending time together, talking for hours, having someone to lean on. Which is great, but what really hit me was... how far many of those if not all ""relationships"" went. Their girlfriends would send them nudes, do s\*xchats over video calls, and in some cases even go as far as doing s\*xual things in restaurants or some other place.

I’ve never experienced anything like that, and now it worries me deeply. I keep asking myself: what if the woman I marry someday has a past like that too? Is this what I “deserve” for not being like the “normal” guys? AM I ALREADY FALLING BEHIND?

Another thing that confuses me: if a woman has done things like showing her body to multiple people, had casual encounters, or even let someone touch her just for something as small as a *400 takar lunch* at a restaurant, and then years later decides to “change”... does that make her the same as me? Does she still deserve my full love, respect and loyalty? People often say the past doesn’t define someone’s worth, but honestly, I struggle to accept that.

And now I’m even more terrified because I can literally see myself being taken over by dark thoughts. I feel myself judging all my female classmates just because they’re female (It's been less that a month since I started attending university). In my mind, even if they had similar pasts, they’d never talk about it openly. They’d just think, “It was his fault, and I’m entitled to start fresh as if nothing happened.” This single thought makes me resent people for no real reason. Worse, I can’t even concentrate in my classes if the course instructor is a woman— because for all I know, she could be just like all the others.

I know this isn’t healthy, and I don’t want to become bitter or hateful. I’d really appreciate if someone could help me get out of this mindset. I’d especially love to hear from people older than me, women, or anyone who has gone through something similar. And if you comment, please mention your age and gender. It would mean a lot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1nalc8n/need_advice_finding_it_hard_to_deal_with_my/,OrneryExpression6918,11,65,2025-09-07 11:48:28,bangladesh

Need advice on English spoken proficiency,"Hi,

I am working with an overseas company remotely. My work is like doing backend tasks. I mean I have assigned tasks via a platform then submitted my tasks when its done. The task requirements are written well, if need  clarification then discuss with the team.   
Recently, I have to conduct meeting with the business holder or clients. There I need to conduct presentation, share demos, gather requirements etc.   
  
The problem is I can understand what they say, I mean my listening skill is good but not the spoken skill. I can manage short conversion or meeting without a problem but when it takes long time then I am out of words or struggle to manage words. Sometime my struggle got noticed easily. Besides I have pronunciation problem as well. 

I have noticed that because of spoken proficiency, at many important meetings I did not get invitation for the presentation, although the task was done by me. I am feel very disappointed. 

  
As a Bangladeshi, I think its a common problem for many of us as we don't have much places for practicing.  

I have heard about spoken course, IELTS etc. Should I enroll one of them? Are those really helpful?   
One of my juniors shared his experience like these are not that helpful instead I can practice at home at regular basis.

I Just hate how most Bangladeshi people just cannot think rationally,"As the title suggests, I just cannot fathom how people in their mid-40s cannot have a rational mindset about anything. Last night a lot of my family members were invited for the celebration of my parents' 25th anniversary, and due to me being an admission candidate, the talk about what I was preparing for came up. I said I am prepping for DU B and C and their face went pale as I said something so blasphemous that their comprehension cannot imagine. Their first question was. ""you read science your entire life and passed HSC with great grades; why are you going for commerce or arts? Why are you not prepping for buet?"" and in response I said that I want to stay at BD, and the current engineering market is very bad, and I don't want to study in a discipline that has so little potential here at bd. and their response was there is a huge market for engineering at BD, and then they proceeded to say the most hilarious thing i have heard in a while. They said, ""Desher CSE er to onek demand."" I just wanted to laugh so hard. As I didn't want to argue with them, I said that ""mama, amar to eto brain nai CSE porar"" and left the living room and said to myself how unaware people are when they give any advice. When the potential of CS graduates getting a stable and good-paying job is at an all-time low in the entire world. when tech mammoths are laying off people, there are so many uncles that give this unsolicited advice. These people just cannot think for 2 minutes before spewing out uncalled advice, and the fact is they aren't illiterate or anything. They just feed into the echo chamber without realising what is happening around the world.

Best dermatologist in DHAKA for Fungal infection (Tinia Cruris),"So basically, I’m looking for a dermatologist because I’ve been dealing with a fungal infection on my body (tinea cruris). Since the 16th of last month, I’ve been using terbinafine antifungal cream, but I haven’t seen any improvement. After researching on YouTube, I found out that nowadays this type of fungal infection has become quite resistant and doesn’t go away easily. I’m really frustrated with this — it itches a lot throughout the day, and even more at night.

If any of you have received treatment from a dermatologist and fully recovered, please let me know.

Does this look like a Hindu goddess?,"People are saying this isn’t Bangladesh’s national costume; it’s India’s national costume. When did Indians start wearing Jamdani sarees? Jamdani sarees originated in Narayanganj, Bangladesh, and are a pride of the country. And some are saying she’s standing on a white lotus. Some even claim our national flower is the pink water lily. People in this country don’t even have the basic knowledge that our national flower is the white water lily, not pink. Forget about Mithila; this is the first time I liked our national costume, and now these “hujur Bangalis” are causing problems again.


These people have never watched Miss World or Miss Universe; they don’t even know how people dress in national costumes, yet they’re making comments. What do they want? Now their problem isn’t Mithila, it’s that this is a Hindu costume.

Getting Euro payments as a Bangladeshi,"Hello everyone!

I recently joined a European company that pays in Euros via Deel dot com.

I’m running into some issues receiving my salary.

Wise seems like a good option, but they don’t allow new accounts from Bangladesh. I’ve heard it might be possible to open a Wise account using a friend’s or cousin’s foreign address.

Has anyone actually done this, and did it work?

Also, Elevate provides online USD bank accounts. Is there any similar service for receiving Euros?

I’ve also looked into Payoneer for a Euro account, but their transaction fees are pretty high, and their service is bad.

I know I could convert Euros to USD inside Deel, but the conversion fee is quite high, and I’d like to avoid losing that much.

The same goes for direct bank transfers to local Bangladeshi accounts. Too much hassle and government fees.

Any workarounds or advice would be really appreciated.

To the US and Europe Based BD community,"To the BD diaspora community in the Western Hemisphere. I am looking for some part time gig. I need some really good quality gig (operations side). I am not looking for generic jobs!

Background: I already have a job and started a business (eating up all my money). I believe I can make it but I am currently operating like a startup i.e, investing heavily in my business infrastructure and personal skill development.

What I am good at:  
\- Operations management (SOP, process mapping, system integrator)  
\- AI Lead qualification through cold email (not generic spam and pray emails but using AI intelligently)

Apart from that, because I am founder, I wear marketing, sales, customer support, and operations hats. I need a job at this moment to sustain my business.

I am not looking for just 'HELP', but if you have something to take care of I can be the guy. I am being transparent. I will event work for free for sometimes to prove my worth to you.

Dhaka's traffic is getting worse and no one seems to care,"In a recent You Tube video You Tuber Luke Damant was asked to choose between Dhaka and Tehran in terms of living place. 
And his reply ""Dhaka is a dump, I'm not living there""

This comment may seem harsh but it's what it is. Dhaka's traffic is a huge part of this. And it has been made worse by uncontrollable amount of Auto Rickshaws. There are way too many Rickshaws and I don't think we need half of them. And not to mention, how dangerously they drive. 
                                                                                      The interim government hasn't done anything meaningfull in improving the traffic. On the contrary, they have made the situation worse by allowing so many Rickshaws.

Bangladesh is severely lacking in Public Libraries and overall access to books.,"There are over 9,000 public libraries and more than 125,000 librarians across the United States, all of which offer a wide variety of resources and services to the communities they serve. Similarly, Australia has a fantastic network of public libraries across all its states. Users can access an extensive catalogue of print, electronic, and multimedia resources as well as free Wi-Fi, computers, printing services, study spaces, groups, classes, and much more by joining a single library. 

According to the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, neighboring India also has an impressive library network, with approximately 1.5 million libraries, including 1.3 million school libraries—the highest single number of libraries globally. The country also hosts over 160,000 public and community libraries, with one public library for every 8,333 people, which is more than double the Asian and global averages. In Sri Lanka, according to the National Library and Document Services Board (NLDSB), there are approximately 1,500 public libraries—one for every 14,595 people. The respective local governments and urban and municipal councils govern all public libraries.

Compared to India and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh has only 71 public libraries, a disproportionately low number considering the population—resulting in there being one public library for every 2,402,143 people. How embarrassing is that? 

I gathered the above information from The Daily Star. For all the talk and complaining we do about ""lack of civic sense"" and political and social justice, we don't pay attention to the very real cause of it all, low access to education especially in rural regions and the distinct lack of libraries in this country. Instead of protesting for delaying or cancelling exam results or forming new colleges or other ludicrous purposes we should protest to increase the availability of books across the country, not just the Capital. This will undoubtedly encourage young under-privileged men and women who want to be educated but don't have the money to enroll in a school. And, as a result will instill civic sense, duty and national responsibility in them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1p0f95k/bangladesh_is_severely_lacking_in_public/,Honest_Ad_6090,55,38,2025-11-18 21:43:20,dhaka

Bangladeshi women should stop settling for less. We are enabling these losers,"Saw a recent post about a woman struggling to find a proper match in bangladesh and the men there started complaining 😂🤣

85% of bengali men are either ugly, fat, not groomed properly or look super messy. Meanwhile, look at other countries and their men. Arab and bengali guys look so similar but are so far off each other lookswise because bengali men dont look after themselves properly. Honestly, your looks show ur discipline. Im not telling u to look like a 10/10 but atleast clean up properly. This is why u guys complain 24/7 about being single.

Secondly, a vast majority of u smoke and drink which causes u to be even uglier and look older. If a woman did the same, you wouldnt even look at her. A lot of u dont even pray 5 times a day and then claim to want pious wives. Honestly ask yourselves if u would want a wife who is like u exactly😂🤣.

To you girls, theres good men out there actually so dont settle for these chapris. We should start settling for better looking men not the old wrinkly ones who smoke and stink. Truth is a man wouldnt look at u if u were also their level of ugly.  Its our fault for settling for losers. Now theyre comfortable with being one. And honestly if u dont mind the perfect match in this life, thats ok. We only have like 40-60 years on this earth 


And honestly, whatever i listed is still bare minimum.

I cant wait to see the same men complain in the comments. If the shoe fits, cinderella😂. Just aim to be better in life rather than barking like a dog in these comments

Government of the pressure group by the pressure group for the pressure group,"
Shafiq Bhai probably forgot to say another success of his Govt:
government of the pressure group  by the pressure group for the pressure group


The Interim Government is an NGO-Gram in all but name—a gram-level outfit!! In many views, it is the weakest administration in Bangladesh’s history: so weak that even the United States would not pursue reciprocal tariff arrangements with it!!

Its leaders often appear timid, unable to control the streets during a period that saw over 1,700 protests in 500 days!! They seem novice and ineffective, struggling even to pass laws, let alone enforce them!! The Interim Government has repeatedly buckled under pressure from relatively small or little-known groups!!

Over the past 15 months, the IG has been bombarded with accusations of inertia and incompetence. Many dismiss it as a “do-nothing, makhon-khawa group” that stumbled into power by luck and achieved nothing and now was looking for an ignominous safe exit!!!

And yet, when I look back, I say with confidence that this has been one of the most consequential governments of Bangladesh in many decades. It has achieved almost everything it set out to do.

#Peace and stability restored. Post revolution revenge attacks brought to a halt.

#The US tariff deal was secured without hiring a single lobbying firm.

#A record number of laws were enacted in just 15 months, including sweeping new labour reforms.

#The July Declaration established a historic new platform, and the July Charter created a political settlement that may reshape national politics for generations.

#The Supreme Court asserted control over the lower judiciary, making it far more difficult for future governments to weaponize bail decisions or pursue politically motivated cases.

#One of the world’s leading port operators signed the Laldia Terminal agreement, laying the foundation for a manufacturing transformation. It is the single largest European investment.

#A new foreign policy framework has positioned Bangladesh at the centre of the Indo-Pacific.

#The economy has been stabilised and returned to a growth trajectory.

#Banking-sector plunder was curbed, the taka stabilised, and inflation contained—food inflation falling from 14 percent to seven.

#According to court proceedings, accountability began to emerge for past abuses, and a long-awaited sense of justice has begun to take shape. Sheikh Hasina has been shown her place!!

#Forced disappearances ceased, the BAL extremist political culture that once dominated our national life has been neutralised, and a cultural revival has followed—bolstered by widely viewed documentaries detailing earlier abuses. It is a Farooki- effect!!

#The RAB now operates under the law rather than informal doctrines, and intelligence agencies have retreated from harassing dissidents. 

#Freedom of press and freedom of speech have been restored. Not a single staged “crossfire” incident has been reported in the last 16 months.

I could go on. As an avid reader of our history, I believe no government in Bangladesh has achieved as much in such a short period as the IG has over these fifteen and a half months.

Full stop.

But no one till now said ""i make money, and here's how you can too, just follow me"" i know that sounds demanding but if you have time, please talk to me, anyone. i'll tell you about me and you will know why i'm so desperate to find a way to make money instead of relying on my shitty job.

Excel Training Centers in Dhanmondi/New Market with Microsoft Certification,"I'm planning to start learning Excel from the basics and want to earn Microsoft official certifications. I'm looking for training centers specifically in the Dhanmondi or New Market area.

Could anyone share their experiences with Excel training programs in these locations? I'm particularly interested in:

* How do they structure their courses? Is it hands-on practice or mostly lectures?
* What learning materials do they provide? (workbooks, practice files, online resources, etc.)
* Do they offer continuous support throughout the training period? Can I reach out to instructors between classes if I get stuck?
* How long does it typically take to complete the certification track?
* What's the approximate cost range?

I want to make sure I'm investing in a center that provides solid, practical training with proper instructor support.

Need advice on what to do..for life..career..etc😭,"Need advice

So i basically worked at this Photoshop/photomela which I joined at first thinking I'll get to learn Microsoft office and other stuff which i did the first couple weeks from the other workers but.. after that i stopped learning stuff, i was there from 9am till isha prayer almost everyday, besides friday or if some mezban/urush/ biye etc type stuff was happening for almost 3 months, it became a job basically, i got paid like 50tk a day for my bus fare. The workers were nice tho ngl about that, even the owner was friendly but when it came to the money side and how long Iam ""working"" there they get pretty strict, obviously I don't like it anymore, i mean fair i learned quite a bit talking with different kind of customers and learning how to use adobe Photoshop and word etc. but.. is it really worth all that? Opening the shop at 9am and cleaning it up myself like... I don't know if im the one who's getting alot and still complaining or other way around, i only feel bad because the staff there were genuinely good people I liked hanging out with.... But that wasn't my goal at the start.. I joined in to learn.. which i stopped doing after awhile. Also another thing is.. Im one of those bekar unemployed, not studying anymore guys, that was the reason i joined this place like 3 months ago... I don't know what to do with my life, clearly this isn't it since im just wasting time here, but I don't know what else I can do...

Edit: thought I should share a bit about myself. Iam 19 years old, I used to live in Oman and came back to Bangladesh at 2022 because i had visa problems, I missed my highschool exams i was basically part of the 2022 batch of SSC examinees.. which i missed and i didn't study since, been 3 years, dad went to UAE 2 Years ago and I thought he'd take me soon.. its been quite awhile im still here.. it's kinda funny but anyways.. I don't know how much longer im gonna be here but I don't want to waste it, someone bestow some wisdom on me, im really broke so IELTS is not on the table right now, im saying this because i got suggested this one multiple times. Im really broke right now, not just me, my whole family, hence why Im still here in bd instead of going to UAE because I can't buy the damn visa and some other stuff. Anyplace i can learn some work.. whatever kind of work that would benefit me later on where I might be able to make some money aswell... Again please don't say IELTS or school.. give me some proper advice older brothers and sisters of this subreddit 🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1p01xpd/need_advice_on_what_to_dofor_lifecareeretc/,One-Breakfast-3410,5,4,2025-11-18 09:55:43,dhaka

Is arranged marriage still a thing in Bangladesh for male in their early 20s?,"I’m a 23-year-old Bangladeshi currently studying in Australia and about to finish my undergrad. I’ve been here for around three years, have a stable income, and I’m considering getting married within the next 1 year so my future spouse can join me while I’m still studying.

Since I’ve been single for a long time (last relationship was in 2018–19), I’m trying to understand how realistic arranged marriage is nowadays for people in their early 20s. My parents are open to helping, but they are also unsure how the process works now since society has changed a lot.

Recently I’ve seen many online discussions about modern dating, trust issues, expectations, betrayal, etc., which honestly made me a bit confused about what the normal marriage process looks like for Bangladeshis today especially for someone living abroad.

For those who went through arranged or semi-arranged marriage recently:
	•	How did the process go?
	•	What should someone like me realistically expect? How do I do the genuine background check.
	•	Any advice for someone who wants a stable, respectful, religiously aligned partner?

I’m Muslim and try my best to practice, and I’m hoping to find someone who shares similar values. Would appreciate honest experiences and guidance.

I am getting really depressed because of this,"My mom actually studied Law at Dhaka University. She was an excellent student back in her day. But she couldn't pursue her career to take care of my older brother, who has autism.

I finished my admission exam in 25. I actually got a seat at DU B unit, but as it was a low-ranking subject, I decided not to pursue it after studying for a couple of months. I chose to enroll in a Private University to get a good subject.

Ig my mom didn't like that. Now, like in every argument, she tells me ""Kono public e chance peye dekhate paros nai"", ""At least amra nijer ma baba ke khushi korte parsi DU te pore"", and if I correct her sentences or oppose her arguments in any other topic, she just replies with ""Tui toh DU teo tike thakte parli na"" and shii.

Ik that DU is tuff for this country, but Idk, now I don't even wanna study anything anymore. Her arguments are seriously getting under my skin. Today we argued and she said ""Tor toh kono bhalo bondhu o nai, amar bondhu ra at least DU te porse, tui toh gazadi der sathe ghure beras"" like tf???? She doesn't even say sorry, and if I argue too much, she decides to spit in my face and call me ""Kulangar"" and a ""Devil's spawn"".

A couple of days back, I actually went to the private university I wanted to get admission in, just to check out the campus and to know a few details about the subject and the cost. My mom insisted that she come with me. I bought her along with me. I talked to the Apu at the office and got the details. BUT, when we were about to leave, my mom just stood up and told the Apu that ""Janen amar chele er ageh DU te chilo, and amio DU r student"". The girl sitting behind us just looked at me like ""Really, is this fr??"" I felt so embarrassed, I just walked out. So is anyone's mom like tis or am I just losing my mind over nothing?

In a school, there are 1,000 students. Among them, 330 students like basketball, 350 students like football, and 450 students like cricket.

80 students like both football and cricket, 110 students like both cricket and basketball, 55 students like both football and basketball, and 30 students like all three games.

1. How many of them do not like any game?

2. How many of them like only one game?

Total student =∪

Students who like basketball=A

Students who like football=B

Students who like crucket=C

What I did

n(A∪B∪C)-n(A∩B)-n(A∩C)-n(B∩C)+n(A∩B∩C)

=915-55-110-80+30

=700

And the way AI is doing it

Only A= n(A)-{n(A∩B)+n(A∩C)}+n(A∩B∩C)

330-(55+110)+30=330-165+30=195.

Only B= n(B)-{n(A∩B)+n(B∩C)}+n(A∩B∩C)

350-(55+80)+30=350-135+30=245.

Only C= n(C)-{n(A∩C)+n(B∩C)}+n(A∩B∩C)

450-(110+80)+30=450-190+30=290.

Total who like only one game

"আছি, কিন্তু যেন নেই।","
It feels like I have everything and still feel empty. It’s like one real solid kind of love from just one person would be enough to fix something in me. And the sad part is I can’t even blame anyone else for why I feel alone. I know there are people around me who would support me if I reached out but I hate the idea of looking needy or like I’m begging for attention. Everyone else was born with this natural humor or charm, and I just… wasn’t. I show up and it’s like I disappear the moment I walk in. People try to include me and they’re actually really kind but even then I feel like I add nothing. I don’t have that spark or talent or anything interesting to bring with me. It’s like I’m just a face pretty maybe but nothing deeper that stands out. I’m slow at understanding people, slower than others at getting jokes or joining conversations. And half the time, I don’t even know what to talk about. It’s not about being introverted either I’ve seen quiet people with this soft charm that makes them easy to love. I just don’t feel like I have that. I feel invisible even when I’m right there.

We need to talk about the border killing issue happening at the Indian border.,"We need to talk about the border killing issue happening at the Indian border.

So,we know that years after years hundreds of Bangladeshis get killed in the India-Bangladesh border.
The excuse given by India is that they were crossing the border illegally.
Now,we know that there has been several instances where some farmers or other people unknowingly went to the other side and then faced the terrible fate at the hands of their BSF.
My question is, can we not raise awareness among our people about to stay INSIDE our borders,to not FLEE from it?
Perhaps we should increase our border patrol and the infrastructure around the border to make our borders MORE SECURE to prevent inflitration AND to prevent anyone even ""accidentally"" going to the other side of the border.
I personally believe this will drastically decrease our border killings.
We cannot just blame everything on India and wait for them to tell their BSF to not use lethal weapons(because that clearly didn't work).
Nevertheless,we should put more diplomatic pressure to ensure our citizens do not lose their lives

I’m tired of struggling… but I’m still trying. Need some honest advice.,"Lately life has been really heavy for me.
আমি জানি, পৃথিবীতে অনেক মানুষ struggle করে, কিন্তু আমি নিজেও একটা phase এর মধ্যে আছি যেখানে মনে হয়—
“আমি কি কখনও ঠিক পথে দাঁড়াতে পারব?”

আমি আমার জীবনে অনেক চেষ্টা করছি — সঠিক পথে হাঁটার, নিজের জন্য কিছু তৈরি করার, পরিবারের জন্য ভালো কিছু করার।
But every time I take one step forward, life pulls me two steps back.

Financial চাপ, পড়াশোনা/কাজের অনিশ্চয়তা, লোকজনের কথা, চাপ, দায়িত্ব… সব মিলিয়ে কখনও কখনও মনে হয় আমি একাই লড়ছি।

আমি রাতে জেগে থাকি, ভাবি—
“আরও কতদিন এমন চলবে?”
“আমি কি সত্যিই succeed করতে পারব?”
“নাকি শুধু চেষ্টা করেই যাব?”

কিন্তু তার পরেও…
প্রতিদিন সকালে আমি আবারও চেষ্টা করি। আবার উঠে দাঁড়াই।
Because deep down, I believe আমার জীবনও বদলাতে পারে।
আমি জানি আমি give up করতে চাই না — বরং support আর guidance চাই।

যদি কেউ পড়ে থাকেন…
Please বলুন—
আপনারাও কি জীবনে এমন কঠিন সময় পার করেছেন? কিভাবে উঠে দাঁড়িয়েছেন? আমি কি করতে পারি?
I’m not looking for sympathy…
Just some honest advice, motivation, বা আপনার নিজের গল্প।

Which BUTEX Textile Engineering Department Should My Younger Brother Choose? Need Honest Advice,"

Hi everyone!
I’m posting on behalf of my younger brother. He’s a science-track student who scored GPA-5 in both SSC and HSC. This year, he has applied to several places—medical, BUET, and a few general universities. He’s also applying to BUTEX, but he’s a bit confused about choosing the right department.

BUTEX has around 11 different departments under Textile Engineering, and since he’s not very familiar with the textile field, he isn’t sure which ones offer better career opportunities, industry demand, research potential, and overall student experience.

If anyone here is a current BUTEX student, graduate, or has experience in the textile industry, your suggestions would be really helpful. Which departments are the most promising right now? And what should he keep in mind while selecting his preferences?

Laptop Issue,"I’m having a serious issue with my Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3i (15IIL05) and need some expert advice. The laptop was originally bought in 2021 and worked fine until I replaced the display in early 2024 due to scratch marks. After about a year, the new display started glitching, showing a horizontal white line and occasionally going completely black. Over time, the screen stopped displaying anything except a faint backlight. I tried updating drivers, reinstalling the OS, and even detaching the HDD, and the laptop worked briefly before a charger accidentally fell on the keyboard from about 40 cm. Since then, the display has been blank again, although the system still powers on. Multiple technicians couldn’t identify the issue, with guesses ranging from GPU to cooling problems. Battery health is also poor. Now, the laptop only shows a dim backlight with no image. I need help figuring out the real cause and whether it’s something repairable possibly a cable issue, display failure, or something else. Any guidance would be appreciated.

I WANNA KNOW ABOUT JAGANNATH UNIVERSITY,"ভাই আমি তো বিশাল বিপদে পড়সি। আমার বাপ মায়ে আমাকে জগন্নাথের ফর্ম তুলতেই দিবে না। এদের ধারণা এটা নাকি কোনো ভার্সিটির কাতারেই পড়ে না এখানে নাকি ফেল্টু/ কোনোমতে পাশ করা পোলাপান পড়াশুনা করে। আর এখান থেকে পড়লে নাকি ফিউচারে কোনো সেক্টরেই দাম পাবো না।সিভি তে এই ভার্সিটি দেখলেই নাকি সিভি ছুড়ে  ফেলায় দিবে।

এদের অভিজ্ঞতা তাই বলে।

এখন ভাই আমি লো মিড লেভেলের স্টুডেন্ট। HSC তে GPA:4.83। টার্গেট A unit। এমন না যে একটা ভার্সিটিতে বসলেই চান্স পেয়ে যাব। তাই জগন্নাথে যদি না বসতে দেয় এরা তাইলে তো আমার জন্য বিশাল লস হয়ে যাবে। তার উপ্রে আমি বড় হইসি ঢাকা শহরে ঢাকায় ইই থাকার ইচ্ছা। তাই এম্নে একটা পাবলিক ভার্সিটি হাতছাড়া করা যায় না।

কিন্তু বাপ মায়ের কথা ""না এখানে তুই চান্স পাইলেও তোরে পড়াবো না। এর চেয়ে ভালো তুই বাংলা কলেজে ডিগ্রি করবি।"" 

জগন্নাথের সিনিয়র ভাইয়া আপুরা যদি একটু প্লিজ বলেন যে আসলে জগন্নাথ কেমন আর আমার মা বাবার ধারণা কতটুকু সত্য। তাইলে নিজেও ব্যাপারটা বুঝতাম আর মা বাবাকেও দেখাতে পারতাম।",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1oynthc/i_wanna_know_about_jagannath_university/,Competitive-Rate-951,29,49,2025-11-16 20:59:00,dhaka
"I’m soft, I’m tired, I’m trying and that’s enough. My heart is loud, even if my presence isn’t.","I have always been a quiet, calm, unnoticeable observer my entire life, but not a typical introvert.  Introvert but a different type that only understands by few. Not because I dislike people or friendships, but because my heart moves slowly. I connect deeply, not quickly. I have a small circle, and it takes me a lifetime to truly let someone in.

The last few years have been messy for me. And a few months ago, I pushed myself to step out of that shell I had lived in for so long. I tried to explore life more, talk to people more, socialize more, and allow myself to feel a little lighter.
But now I feel exhausted in a way that is hard to explain.
Overwhelmed. Drained. Lost.
Like I took ten steps forward just to end up standing in the same old place again.

I don’t want to distance myself from the few people I genuinely care about, because I don’t want misunderstandings or to seem uninterested. But at the same time, I feel like I can’t handle too much anymore. My mind needs silence but my heart doesn’t want to hurt anyone. And this conflict is eating me up.

I don’t think everyone would understand this sudden wave of emptiness I’m feeling — how it comes without warning, how it makes my efforts feel wasted, how it reminds me that healing is not a straight line. It’s confusing, and honestly, painful.

Still, I won’t give up. I know life requires adjusting, and maybe this is just another phase I need to breathe through.
I just wanted to share this here, without being judged or misunderstood, because writing feels like my only escape sometimes.

If any of you feel the same way, you’re not alone. You can share your thoughts too or tell me what helps you survive these phases.
And whatever you’re going through, please be kind to yourself and to others. We’re all carrying things we don’t talk about.

অনেক বাংলাদেশি অভিবাসীর সবচেয়ে বড় বাধা প্রায়ই তাদের নিজের কমিউনিটিই হয়। একটি সাম্প্রতিক ঘটনা দেখিয়েছে—কীভাবে একজন লোক ব্যক্তিগত বিরোধের কারণে নতুনদের সাহায্য করার জন্য তৈরি একটি সাপোর্ট গ্রুপকে নিজের ইচ্ছামতো গেটকিপিং করছিল। বিষয়টি জানার পরও সিনিয়র সদস্যরা গুরুত্ব দিয়ে দেখেননি,"Translated my previous post. 

সবার প্রতি সালাম, আমি জেমস—অবশ্যই আমার আসল নাম নয়, পরিচয় গোপন রাখার জন্য।

ঘটনাটি শেয়ার করার আগে কিছু প্রেক্ষাপট দিচ্ছি। আমি কয়েক বছর আগে অস্ট্রেলিয়ায় আসি। প্রথমে অন্য একটি বড় শহরে পড়াশোনা করি, তারপর ভালো সুযোগের জন্য কুইন্সল্যান্ডে চলে আসি। আল্লাহর রহমতে বিভিন্ন জব করেছি এবং ২০২২ সাল থেকে স্বাস্থ্যখাতে পড়াশোনা ও কাজ করছি—এখনও করছি।

বাংলাদেশ থেকে যারা আসেন তারা জানেন, স্বাস্থ্যখাতে বাংলাদেশি দেখা কতটাই বিরল। আমার ক্লাসে বা কর্মস্থলে কখনও কোনও বাংলাদেশি পাইনি। গত ৩.৫ বছরে কুইন্সল্যান্ডে আমি মূলত ফিলিপিনো, ইন্ডিয়ান, নেপালি ও অন্যান্য জাতিগোষ্ঠীর সঙ্গে কাজ করেছি। তাদের কমিউনিটি যতটা ঐক্যবদ্ধ দেখে, সেটা আমাকে অনুপ্রাণিত করেছিল বাংলাদেশি কমিউনিটির সঙ্গে যুক্ত হতে। আমার অবশ্যই লোকাল বন্ধু আছে, কিন্তু একে তো সংস্কৃতির একটা টান থাকে, আর আমি কখনও আমার সংস্কৃতি থেকে দূরে থাকতে চাইনি। আমি সত্যিই চেয়েছিলাম এমন কিছু মানুষ পেতে যাদের সঙ্গে ভাষা, সংস্কৃতি, ব্যাকগ্রাউন্ড মিলে।

একটি গ্রুপ ছিল, যেটি কুইন্সল্যান্ডের একটি বাংলাদেশি স্টুডেন্ট অ্যাসোসিয়েশনের সাথে যুক্ত। কেউ আমাকে সেখানে অ্যাড করেছিলেন। জুলাই ২০২৪ এর প্রোটেস্টের পর গ্রুপটি বেশ সক্রিয় হয়ে উঠেছিল—মানুষ পরস্পরকে সাহায্য করছিল, কানেক্ট হচ্ছিল। কিন্তু আমি যোগ দেওয়ার কয়েক মিনিট পরেই হঠাৎ আমাকে গ্রুপ এবং চ্যাট—দুটো থেকেই ব্যান করে দেওয়া হল।

গ্রুপটির অ্যাডমিন—ধরি তার নাম এন—সে আমার এক কাজিনের বন্ধু। কয়েক বছর আগে আমাদের মধ্যে ব্যক্তিগত একটি ঝামেলা হয়েছিল, যা কমিউনিটির সঙ্গে কোনও সম্পর্ক ছিল না। সে সেই পুরনো বিষয়টি ভুলতে পারেনি এবং অ্যাডমিন ক্ষমতা ব্যবহার করে ব্যক্তিগত বিরোধের কারণে আমাকে ব্যান করে দিল।

শুরুতে তেমন পাত্তা দিইনি। কিন্তু কিছুদিন আগে যখন আমি রেন্টাল ভ্যাকান্সির পোস্ট দিচ্ছিলাম, তখন ঘটনা বদলে যায়। ভাগ্যক্রমে আমি এমন জায়গায় থাকি যেখানে মালিক আমাকে ঘর সাবলেট করতে বিশ্বাস করেন। এভাবে কিছু বাংলাদেশি রুম খুঁজতে এসে আমার সঙ্গে যোগাযোগ করল, এবং শেষে তিনজন বাংলাদেশি আমার বাসায় উঠল।

প্রতিদিন তাদের সাথে আমার নিজের ভাষায় কথা বলতে বলতে বুঝতে পারলাম—এতদিন আমি এই কানেকশনটা কতটা মিস করছিলাম। ৩–৪ বছর শুধু ইংরেজিতে কথা বলে এবং স্বাস্থ্যখাতে বাংলাদেশি না পেয়ে, মাতৃভাষায় স্বাভাবিক কথোপকথনই যেন মন শান্ত করে দিয়েছিল।

তাদের একজনের সাথে আমি তাহসানের কনসার্টেও গিয়েছিলাম। সেখানে এক সিনিয়র ভাইয়ের সঙ্গে—ধরি তার নাম এস—দেখা হল। উনি খুব ভালোভাবে অভিবাদন জানালেন, আমি পুরো ঘটনা বললাম। উনি বললেন দেখবেন। কিছুই হয়নি, এবং সত্যি বলতে তাকে দোষ দিই না। তার পরিবার-দায়িত্ব আছে; বেশিরভাগ মানুষ এমন ক্ষুদ্র ঝামেলায় জড়াতে চান না। তাই এটাও ছেড়ে দিলাম।

কিছুদিন পর কেউ একজন এন-এর বিরুদ্ধে অভিযোগ পোস্ট করল—একজনকে হুমকি দেওয়া এবং রাজনৈতিক সংযোগের ইঙ্গিত নিয়ে। তখন আরেকজন সম্মানিত কমিউনিটি লিডার—ধরি তার নাম এ—পাবলিকলি লিখলেন যে বুলিং, হয়রানি বা বৈষম্য কাউকেই ছাড় দেওয়া হবে না।

আমি তাকে ব্যক্তিগতভাবে জিজ্ঞেস করলাম,
“যদি যিনি এগুলো করছেন তিনি কমিউনিটি লিডার হন, তাহলে?”
তিনি বললেন, ভুল তো ভুলই।

তখন আমি তাকে পুরো ঘটনা খুলে বললাম—কীভাবে আমি শুধু নিজের কমিউনিটির সাথে সংযোগ করতে চেয়েছিলাম, সাহায্য করতে ও নিজেও কানেক্টেড থাকতে চেয়েছিলাম।
ভাই এ এন-এর সাথে যোগাযোগ করেন। কাজিনকেও বললাম বিষয়টি। আমি একটাই কথা স্পষ্ট করলাম—পুরনো ব্যক্তিগত ঝগড়াকে অজুহাত বানিয়ে কাউকে কমিউনিটি থেকে বাদ দেওয়া অন্যায়। অ্যাডমিন হওয়া মানে কারও উপর ব্যক্তিগত ক্ষমতা খাটানোর লাইসেন্স নয়।

কাজিন এবং ভাই এ দু’জনই এন-এর সাথে কথা বলার চেষ্টা করেন, কিন্তু সে বিষয়টি এড়িয়ে যায়। শেষে সে শুধু জানায়—সে আমাকে গ্রুপে নেবে না। কোনও যুক্তি নেই, কোনও ব্যাখ্যা নেই—শুধু জেদ।

অনেকে সহজেই বুঝতে পারবেন আমি কার কথা বলছি, কারণ এর আগেও তাকে বাংলাদেশের একটি রাজনৈতিক দলের সাথে জড়িত বলে অভিযোগ উঠেছিল। মজার বিষয়, সে নিজেই বলেছিল সে দলের নয়, কারণ সে নাকি তাদের বিরুদ্ধে “প্রোটেস্ট করেছিল”—কিন্তু তার আচরণ ঠিক সেই গত দশকের দেশের রাজনৈতিক চরিত্রগুলোর মতো।

সে এমনকি আমার কাজিনকে বলেছে কিছু নির্দিষ্ট আত্মীয়কে নাকি অভিযোগ করবে এবং “অ্যাকশন নেবে”—মানে পরিস্থিতি বাড়াতে চাইছিল, অথচ আমার উদ্দেশ্য ছিল শুধু ন্যায্যতা। আমি কাজিনকে বললাম—মানুষ জানুক বা না জানুক, আমার আপত্তি নেই; আমি শুধু চাই অন্যরা জানুক কীভাবে কিছু লোক ভদ্রতার মুখোশ পরে ব্যক্তিগত শত্রুতার বদলা নেয়।

দীর্ঘদিন ধরেই তার আচরণ নিয়ে বিভিন্ন মানুষের কাছ থেকে গুজব ও অভিযোগ শুনেছি—যেগুলো আমি বলব না, কারণ তার মতো পেছনে লাগা বা অপবাদ দেওয়া আমার উদ্দেশ্য নয়।

যা আমাকে সবচেয়ে বিস্মিত করেছে—সে আমাকে ব্যান করলেও, স্বাস্থ্যখাত সম্পর্কিত কোনও তথ্য জানতে কেউ তাকে জিজ্ঞেস করলে সে আমার নম্বর তাদের কাছে দিয়ে দিত।
কারণ “এন ভাইয়া আপনার নম্বর দিছে”—এই কথাই শোনা যেত।
মানে, তার নিজের প্রয়োজনে আমি ভালো, কিন্তু কমিউনিটিতে আমার থাকা সে মেনে নিতে পারে না।

আমি প্রচুর জাতিগোষ্ঠীর মানুষের সাথে কাজ করেছি—অস্ট্রেলিয়ান, পাঞ্জাবি, ফিলিপিনো, নেপালি, সাউথ ইন্ডিয়ান—কিন্তু এমন নোংরা গেটকিপিং আর কোথাও দেখিনি। যাদের কাছে গিয়েছিলাম তারা চেষ্টা করেছেন—সেটা আমি সম্মান করি—কিন্তু বেশি কিছু করার ছিল না।

তাই হ্যাঁ—এমন সাপে ভরা মানুষের ব্যাপারে সতর্ক থাকুন। তারা বাইরে থেকে হাসিমুখে সাহায্যকারী সাজে, ছোট্ট কোনও উপকার করলে দশজনকে বলে বেড়ায়, অথচ আড়ালে ক্ষমতার অপব্যবহার করে। যে সত্যিকারের সাহায্য করে, সে চুপচাপ করে; সে ক্ষমতা দেখিয়ে মানুষকে অপমান করে না।

আমার ব্যক্তিগত ভাবে তেমন কষ্ট নেই। আমার কাজ ও পড়াশোনা ভালোই চলছে, আল্লাহর রহমতে সব ঠিক আছে। দুঃখ শুধু এই—বিদেশের মাটিতে নিজের কমিউনিটির সাথে কানেক্ট হতে চেয়ে, সংস্কৃতির টান বজায় রাখতে চেয়ে, কেউ একজনের ছোট মনের কারণে এমনভাবে দূরে সরিয়ে দেওয়া হয়।

সত্যিকারের সদাচরণ নীরব।
সত্যিকারের নেতৃত্ব ব্যক্তিগত আবেগ নয়, কমিউনিটির স্বার্থ দেখে।

এমন ভণ্ড, ছদ্মবেশী মানুষ থেকে সাবধান থাকুন। নিজের পরিচিতজনদেরও সচেতন করুন।

আর যদি আপনারা জানেন কীভাবে এমন মানুষদের ব্যাপারে আরও বেশি মানুষকে সচেতন করা যায়, তাহলে আমাকে জানান।”",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1oycgiz/অনক_বলদশ_অভবসর_সবচয_বড_বধ_পরযই_তদর_নজর_কমউনটই_হয/,jbttss,4,6,2025-11-16 10:32:02,dhaka

Struggling as an Artist,"Spend a decent amount of my time doing freelance work online. Enjoyed my time working as a concept artist.

Since the dawn of AI, my career has been suffering a lot on freelance platforms.Tried working offline jobs as a graphic designer but I never enjoyed it. 
Can't find jobs as an artist either. I was super introverted during the beginning of my career where I didn't focus on my 'Social Branching Skills'. Now that I'm trying to do that, seems like I'm already too late.

Breaking the ice now, I was, I am a bit scared to post on social media or reach out to people as well.

Seeking Investment to Scale My Small E-commerce Brand (Bangladesh) — Need Guidance &amp; Partners,"Hi everyone,

I’m building a small e-commerce brand called Chikbik, focused on budget-friendly toys. I started this business with very little capital and have been running it alone — sourcing, importing, marketing, fulfillment, everything.

To show transparency, I’m attaching my lifetime earnings screenshot from my shop. This is what I’ve built with zero investors and limited resources.

What I’ve Achieved So Far

Built an online presence on Facebook &amp; Marketplace

Started selling imported toys

Built a base of repeat customers

Managed all operations independently

Monthly sales increasing slowly but steadily


Why I Need Investment

Right now the main constraints are:

Limited working capital

Unable to bring bigger stock

Want to create a more branded experience

Need funds for packaging, marketing &amp; improved product line


My Goal

To turn Chikbik into a recognizable small toy brand in Bangladesh, with:

Better branding

More product variety

Dedicated marketing

Stable inventory flow


What I’m Looking For

A small to mid-level investor

Someone who understands e-commerce in emerging markets

A partner open to discussing equity sharing

Mentorship is also welcome


What I Can Provide

Full transparency (I’ve shown my earnings screenshot)

Clear growth plan

Constant reporting and performance updates

A motivated founder who works full-time on the business


If anyone is interested in discussing or guiding me, I’d appreciate any advice or conversation.

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1oy2lzd/seeking_investment_to_scale_my_small_ecommerce/,ledlips6214,2,1,2025-11-16 02:53:14,dhaka

Does anyone else think that people of this generation is intellectually poor?,"Whenver I see old movies like Feluda or other detective characters, other Satyajit Ray movies, or Mrinal Sen movies. Or let's say western films, even 90s films had really unique plots, and characters of books and films, or even random people were much smarter in fashion and behavior. They had a depth in personality. If you'd see students of our universities around that time, even they looked really smart. Do you ever think why? Maybe I'm an old soul and love old things.

Trying to collect foreign currency notes — where can I actually get my first ones in Dhaka?,"Man, listen… I’m a student here in Dhaka, and I’m trying to start collecting **foreign currency notes**. Sounds simple, right? WRONG. Because I realized I have never — and I mean *never* — held foreign money in my hands. If you threw a euro at me right now, I’d be like, “Dang! Is this what rich people feel like?!”

I tried checking with the banks.  
They hit me with, “Sir, do you have a passport? Visa? Travel plan?”  
And I’m standing there like, “Passport?? I don’t even have travel *dreams* yet! I got NID and student ID — that’s the whole package!”

So now I’m here asking the people of Reddit before I embarrass myself again:

* **Where can I get my first few foreign notes in Dhaka without all the hassle?**
* **Anybody know legit collectors, shops, or online spots where they don’t try to hustle you?**
* **Should I start with the cheap old-school notes first?**
* **And yo, what scams should I watch out for? ’Cause I ain’t tryna get played like that.**

If you got advice, drop it here. Don’t leave me out here struggling like Smokey on a Monday.

I GOT FIRED FROM MY JOB AT THE FIRST DAY,"So, there's this hospitality group in Bangladesh hired me as the role of marketing officer. I didnt know much about them, so i simply made a post in a Facebook career assist group and simply asked about the company and the salary they are offering. So that night the HR called me and told me to delete the post immediately and told me it was really immature of me to make a post like this. I simply apologised and delete the post immediately. Later the next day was off day and I was suppose to join from today (15th of Nov). So i was told to be present there at 10 am. After that, the receptionist told me to wait for the HR and I waited for like 2 goddamn hours. Then they told me to go the cabin where HR and the manager were present. They let me sit and told me that we aren’t continuing with you because of the post you made (are you fucking kidding me!?) I simply said that it was my right to know about your company since your digital presence isn’t visible enough. Then she dared to threat me saying that, 'eshob khetre amra police case kore thaki, apni fresher dekhe kichu korini' duh. Tarpor the manager started giving me lecture but i left the room right away. They were kept saying that miss we arent finished yet PLEASE kotha shunun Like DUH you've wasted  my 2 fucking hours now you want me to listen your lecture????

App that shows live Bangladesh Railway train positions - Find My Train: Bangladesh,"Hi everyone,  
I built an Android app '**Find My Train: Bangladesh**', to help people track Bangladesh Railway trains in real time. The app shows the live position of running trains so you can locate your train easily. My goal is to make train tracking simple and helpful for everyone.

You can try the testing version by following these steps:

**Step 1:** Join the tester Google Group [(link here)](https://groups.google.com/g/mytraintrackerbd) \[ [https://groups.google.com/g/mytraintrackerbd](https://groups.google.com/g/mytraintrackerbd) \]

**Step 2:** Install the app from the Play Store [(Playstore)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app) \[ [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app) \]

Note: Without step 1, step 2 won't work. If the app does not appear, please make sure you are using the same Google account for both steps.

After trying it, if you notice any issue in loading, tracking, or timing, please share your feedback in the comments.

Does Milestone College charge extra fees for taking a TC?,"I got into Milestone College this year, and at first I thought I could manage everything. But over time, I’ve been getting frequent burnouts, I get sick often, and the long daily commute is draining my energy.And the college says to maintain 100% attendance but It is becoming difficult for me to maintain attendance as required. 
Because of this, I’ve been thinking about taking a TC (Transfer Certificate) and switching to a place that’s easier for me to handle.

Before I make any decisions, I wanted to ask:
Do colleges like Milestone usually charge extra fees for issuing a TC?
If anyone here has taken a TC from Milestone — or any ex Milestone student knows abt this— I’d really appreciate knowing:

How much did it cost (if anything)?

Was the process difficult / long?

Any tips to make it smoother?

Any tips for dealing with if they don't  hand the TC easily (would be appreciated)?

should i change schools and take commerce?,"my finals are starting from like this thursday and today during lunch my mother just asks me if i want to take a gap year change school and like change subjects like in science rn but but even when i was in 7th grade my parents agreed that i would commerce in 9th grade because i was already horrible and maths and i personally dont think i am smart enough to be a science student not like ill fail in my annuals although i did in half yearly but that was entirely because i didnt even touch my books,but this time i swear i really am trying its not like i am gonna get to the top overnight but atleast i wouldnt fail and i am expecting to for more than just a passing grade.but the problem is that i have been telling my parents since september of last year that our school doesnt have any other subject except for science and in college although they do have commerce and arts both those subjects are taught in bengali and i am an ev student now i am not terrible at bangla but ik i would survive that.                                                                                                                                    so when i tried to speak about changing schools with my mother at the beginning of this year she lashed out on me calling me lazy and saying that my life hasnt even started yet and ik zero things about hardship and like i am trying to find an easy way out by changing schools and i took that blow personally and me doing sb like literally failing in half yearly has everything to do with my being irresponsible towards my academics but like i said i am really am trying this time but there are times when i just feel so stupid and like feel like i have no job even studying science like my mother agreed that she would like get me into a diff commerce collage after ssc but like ik i genuinely dont have what it take to survive in  a public admission test like ill do well in ssc if i just try hard enough but idk what happens after that and nw literally just a week before my finals starts my mother is asking me if i want to change school and take commerce but idk if she had asked me that even a week earlier my answer would have been yes without a second thought but i just really dont know right now what i am supposed to do like i just felt like she was joking with me even then i just can not do this honestly although i do think in the long run it will be better if i changed schools and took commerce but what i am really worried about if like repeating a year would mean ill appear a year older than i was supposed to be in all of my certificates and thats the part i am most worried about",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1oxp48x/should_i_change_schools_and_take_commerce/,vernoniestacos,4,3,2025-11-15 17:11:09,dhaka

2026 Referendum (গণভোট),"With the 2026 referendum coming up alongside the national election, I am curious to hear what people genuinely think about it. Do you support the July charter reforms, oppose them or feel unsure due to the complexity and lack of clarity?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1oxnxkl/2026_referendum_গণভট/,Ark_rivia,13,13,2025-11-15 15:59:06,dhaka
I have 2 lakhs to invest | need suggestions to generate 30k–50k/month within 2–3 months (Bangladesh),"Hey everyone,  
I’m looking for some solid guidance and ideas.

I currently have **2 lakhs taka** that I can invest into something productive. My goal is to start generating **30,000 to 50,000 taka per month** within the next **2–3 months**. I can stretch my personal expenses a bit, so I’m willing to take calculated risks just nothing extreme.

A bit about my background so you can suggest better:

* I’ve worked **2+ years as a Business Development Manager** (client acquisition + client management + scaling accounts) Before that I worked as a Freelancer on Upwork since 2021 and had Top Rated badges on there.
* Experience in **telemarketing**, **WordPress web design**, **affiliate marketing**, **social media marketing**, and **client hunting**
* Previously collaborated with **international call centers**, providing them with projects and helping them operate
* Overall, I have a good understanding of **digital money-making models**, but I’m now looking for something more strategic or higher-ticket

What I’m hoping for:  
A **realistic roadmap**, investment ideas, or business models where my experience fits and where 2 lakhs can be enough to get started. Sometimes one suggestion from someone else’s experience can open a whole new direction so I’d really appreciate your input.

If you’ve built something similar before or know someone who has, please share what worked for you.

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1oxnwpg/i_have_2_lakhs_to_invest_need_suggestions_to/,Aggravating-Jury9096,0,27,2025-11-15 15:57:33,dhaka

"My grandfather (Nana) told my mom when she was a child that laughing too loudly would make her sinful and made her recite an Arabic verse whenever she laughed. Even normal laughter made her stop midway and quickly recite the verse, believing she had sinned.","I felt so bad for her. I’ve never seen her laugh loudly. And on the rare times she did, she would suddenly stop and recite the verse. She was also taught the line: “হাসিলে কাঁদিতে হয়, জানিবে নিশ্চয়,” so she believed that if she laughed too much, she’d cry even more. But what good did that do? Even without laughing, she still cried. Since my childhood, I’ve seen her crying again and again.

Has a similar thing happened to any of you? Share your experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1oxmplw/my_grandfather_nana_told_my_mom_when_she_was_a/,the-machine-m4n,69,37,2025-11-15 14:40:15,dhaka
