        "body": "Every winter (Nov–Feb), the Indo-Gangetic Plain becomes one of the world’s most polluted regions. During this period, the **prevailing wind direction shifts to northwesterly**, moving air masses from **Punjab→ UP →Bihar → West Bengal → Bangladesh**.  \nWind-flow maps clearly show this continuous west-to-east transport of PM2.5.\n\nAs a result, the same pollution cloud sitting over northern India flows directly into **Rajshahi → Dhaka**, causing AQI spikes above 300–400. This explains why Bangladesh’s pollution becomes extreme only in winter, despite having similar local emission sources year-round.\n\nMeanwhile, **Northeast India remains comparatively clean** because the **Meghalaya, Tripura, and Chittagong hill ranges** create a topographic barrier. These hills block lower-level atmospheric transport, preventing the polluted air mass from entering Assam/Meghalaya.  \nSo the regional airflow essentially funnels the Indo-Gangetic pollution plume southward into Bangladesh.\n\nBangladesh does contribute its own emissions. Brick kilns, vehicular exhaust, construction dust, but the **severity** of winter smog comes from the **cross-border pollution transported from India by seasonal wind patterns**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9z3cn31px2g1.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d97de17605cfb70055b61daf77752203e17c4f92",

        "title": "Need suggestions regarding the public universities in Bangladesh? Are they worth it???",
        "body": "[ This post is not to offend anyone here, just for some perspective ]\n\n\nHey, so i just finished my HSC this year from a renowned college in Bangladesh and am currently into the admission process for Public University. My family comes from a military background, although we are not so much \"hi-fi\" type rich people that my parents can afford my education in any of the private universities here.\n\n\nMy dream is to become a corporate lawyer and i want to live in one of the New York boroughs in my 30s and work somewhere like latham and watkins or Kirkland and Ellis. This is a very rough plan, but i envision it to be something just like this.\n\n\nNow the thing is, it's been almost two months since i started going to multiple coaching centers and i am literally getting culture shock. The competition is insane and i am totally fine with that, but the philosophy of some kids here is out of this world. They kind of worship dhaka university/ dmc/ buet; it's like they are not enthusiastic about what they wanna be in life, rather they are enthusiastic about just the university tag, that's all.\n\n\nAnd why am i getting culture shock? I graduated high school from a military residential college (i don't want to disclose but ig you can guess) and i have been active in various competitions, stage, sports, enjoyment of life and whatnot. I have never been with people who are only obsessed with education; i have been with people who are enthusiastic about improving themselves. But let's move on to something more real.\n\n\nI visited the universities when i was in 11th grade. I had the privilege to visit the halls and the facilities, and sorry to say, but i wasn't fond of the educational environment nor the accommodation facilities there either! I totally understand that some people might be dying to end their generational poverty and this is the only way, and i am also not super rich or anything, but considering the college life i had, i don't think i can mix with this public university culture and stuff. I am also a big critic of not only the philosophy of how some people think about this but also the students' normal behaviors. I know some people who are fairly wealthy (one guy literally has a fourteen-storey building in my city, so definitely he is not dying to buy a facewash or a nice shirt) yet still dress so poorly,,no formal etiquette, no self-grooming, nothing. And this is the case for most here in public university. It's not someone's money i am a critic of, rather it's their choices that i strongly don't understand.\n\n\nNow my real concern and query to my elders and respected seniors who had the privilege of studying in publics in this subreddit is: based on how i feel, what do you think i should do at this point? Am i wrong and seeing this world through rainbow-tinted glasses? Can i really reach my ambitions studying in public universities? Or should i leave this country asap with a scholarship if i get one? Is it going to be worth fighting in this huge admission war? Am i the only person who thinks like this?\n\n\nWould love to hear your opinions!! And please don't take it offensively, i respect everyone regardless if your perspective is different, rather would love to hear your constructive criticism!!",

        "body": "The government collapsed in July–August 2024 after a student-led protest because citizens demanded merit over quota. Sounds noble, right? Except the whole thing was hijacked from the very beginning.\n\nThose naïve, illiterate social-media activists and the “cool Dhaka kids” who wanted some good Instagram content ran to the streets without realizing a basic truth: BNP–Shibir gundas hijacked the movement on day one. They staged everything. They used those same cool Dhaka kids as puppets. They manipulated every moment of it.\n\nAnd nobody ever stopped to ask a single real question:\n\nWho are these NCP “student leaders”? What are their qualifications? What drove them to lead this protest? When did these uncles disguised as students actually graduate? What have they done with their lives besides student politics?\n\nThe same people who screamed about merit are now perfectly happy letting these criminals become the next representatives in government.\n\nI am not supporting one side over the other. I am simply asking everyone to think for once.\n\nDo you really want to live in a cave and pretend that:\n\nThe Awami League government falling automatically turned Bangladesh into a civilized, developed South Asian utopia under Dr. Yunus?\n\nBecause here is the reality:\n\nYunus is not making any key decisions. His cabinet is. And they were chosen based on quota, not medha.\n\nIn any functioning country, an interim government must be neutral, not tied to any political party. But our current administration is doing the exact opposite. Whenever NCP orders Yunus to do something, he complies out of fear.\n\nAnd honestly, this feels exactly like what the plan was all along.  \nPeople forget he formed Nagorik Shakti (Citizens’ Power) back in 2007.  \nConnect the dots.\n\nThis government is intentionally delaying elections while handing NCP an open license to operate. Meanwhile Nepal had a government collapse and their interim immediately declared election timelines… exactly what an interim is supposed to do.\n\nYunus is enjoying his new status and free private flights to new destinations on taxpayers’ money, while the Bangladeshi cool kids think being “politically conscious” means trash-talking a party that has already fled the country, or using fancy buzzwords to blame foreign nations instead of holding the current administration accountable.\n\nNow let us talk about the outcome.\n\nThere is no solid evidence that the original cause gained anything. It is a full-on shitshow.  \nThe trial was a shitshow because it means nothing.  \nThe world is literally laughing at Bangladesh.\n\nDeath sentencing people in absentia is a joke, but people ate it up and celebrated anyway.\n\nWhat did the interim actually change?\n\nThe economy is collapsing.  \nMurders, robbery, theft, rape statistics are skyrocketing.  \nThe garments industry is struggling with hundreds of factories shutting down.\n\nBut sure… the so-called “student leaders” are making slogans and people are cheering like everything is fine.\n\nAnd then there is the new trend online.\n\nPeople are making cool edits of Lutfor Zaman Babor, acting like he is some hero out of a Netflix series. Why is everyone blindfolded? or why the “student advisors” who magically appeared out of nowhere suddenly became the face of the movement. Not a single person questioned what medha qualified them to “advise” ministerial portfolios. But somehow they went from nobody to VIP overnight. Rags to riches, just like that.\n\nAnd then there is the sudden obsession with Tareq Zia, who has now become everyone’s eye candy. People act like reposting aesthetic edits of corrupt political bloodlines is activism.\n\nStudy history. Learn about their smuggling stories. Learn about JI.  \nLook at patterns.  \nYou are being emotionally manipulated by social media every single day.\n\nDo not let TikTok edits and Facebook reels generate your political opinions. Think for yourself. Stop idolizing netas who have done nothing for you.\n\nBlaming “the West” or “India” will not take Bangladesh anywhere.  \nBlaming outsiders is the easiest way to avoid looking in the mirror.\n\nEducate yourself.  \nLearn the facts.  \nStop being a pawn in someone else’s political game.",

I work remotely and plan to continue doing so, which gives me the flexibility to relocate.\n\nI’ve already discussed this with my parents, and they’re willing to rent out our apartment in Dhaka and move somewhere nicer if we can find a good place. I also worry a lot about the risk of a major earthquake. people laugh it off, but it feels like only a matter of time before Dhaka faces something serious. So I’d prefer a place that’s relatively safer in terms of earthquakes. Also, with good medical facilities near by, as my parents are getting old and I don't want to risk anything.\n\nWhat do you think about Rajshahi? I really liked the city when I visited. The only downside is that it gets extremely hot. Would air conditioning be enough to stay comfortable?\n\nI’d appreciate your insights. ",

        "body": "I think you all know that the Interim Government has finalized the referendum date and its question. However, some of you may not realize that they played dirty with the BNP at the last minute. Let me explain how.\n\nThe BNP submitted a note of dissent on many of the proposals recommended by the Consensus Commission. The IG and the Commission were not satisfied with the outcome. That's why they initially tried to ignore the BNP's note of dissent by not incorporating it into the July Charter, but they were forced to do so when the BNP stated they would not sign it otherwise. Then they attempted to disregard the BNP's note of dissent again by framing the referendum question in such a way that the reforms desired by the IG, the Consensus Commission, and most parties would have a higher chance of receiving a YES vote. Just look at the options if you don't believe me.\n\n[Referendum Question](https://preview.redd.it/gr8i1kcaze1g1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d24cc22d8eca02fba65b2c52cd94bf5f29e3009)\n\n  \n  \nThis was not supposed to happen. The purpose of the Consensus Commission was to include only those proposals in the referendum that received consensus from all 30 parties. I know the content of the first two questions did not, don't remember about the third option though. Only the fourth option reached consensus.\n\nThe BNP can't fully oppose this because if they do, they would be labelled anti-reform by almost everyone. Notice that other political parties like Jamat, NCP, Gonoodhikar Parishad and others aren't talking much about the question either because they are supportive of what the IG is doing as they benefit from it. \n\nThe BNP has already hinted that they will not accept the result imposed on them by some elites.",

        "body": "Hey everyone,  \nIm a 26 year-old male and I’ve been struggling with hair loss from a pretty young age. I have been visiting a doctor who prescribed me some medicines which I have been taking for the last 3 months.\n\nRecently, he suggested that I go for a **hair transplant** and also take **PRP treatment**. When I asked if I could recover some of my lost hair, he told me that whatever is gone is gone and that the only solution now is a transplant.\n\nBut I have seen some of my friends who had worse hair loss than me. They said they used **finasteride** and **minoxidil** and that it helped them. Finasteride stopped their hair fall and minoxidil helped regrow some hair.\n\nI did a bit of research and found that both drugs are **FDA approved** and can give results as long as you keep using them. So I asked my doctor about using finasteride and minoxidil but he didn’t prescribe them. He said these only help maintain existing hair and won’t bring back the lost ones.\n\nHonestly, its discouraging because Im spending around 10k per month but Im told there is no chance of recovery. It is just for maintenance. I don’t want to go for a hair transplant yet and I also don’t want to use any medication without proper medical guidance.\n\nSo Im thinking of **changing my doctor**, hopefully to someone who is experienced in treating hair loss and open to trying finasteride/minoxidil under supervision.\n\n**I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone in Bangladesh (specially Dhaka):**\n\n* Are you using **finasteride** or **minoxidil**? What kind of results have you seen?\n* Any **recommended dermatologists or hair specialists** in Dhaka who treat hair fall properly and guide patients with these medications?\n\nI just want to get some honest opinions and maybe find the right doctor who can help me recover whatever hair is still possible to save.\n\nThanks in advance",

        "title": "My Story",
        "body": "I’m a 21-year-old boy. My father has schizophrenia. After I was born, my mother couldn’t breastfeed me. I’m the first child in the family, and when I was four years old, my little sister was born. My mother became very busy with her, and I didn’t get the time or care I needed.\n\nWhen I was a child, I used to spend most of my days outside, playing with my friends. They felt more like my family than anyone else. I would visit their houses and stay out until evening.\n\nWhen I was about seven or eight, I started to learn swimming. One day, some pond water got stuck in my ear and caused a terrible infection. My ear began to rot from the inside, and it was extremely painful. My father refused to let me take antibiotics, so for days I suffered before being treated with homeopathic medicine.\n\nWhen I was nine, my parents decided to move away. Leaving my friends behind broke my heart. The new place was quiet and lonely. I stayed home most of the time, surrounded by my parents’ constant fights. My father often left the house early in the morning and came back very late—or sometimes not until the next day. My mother would yell all day and curse him. Both of them worked as primary school teachers. I felt trapped in their arguments, and I often thought about dying.\n\nAfter finishing 10th grade, I left home to live with my maternal uncle in the capital city. I couldn’t really share my feelings with anyone.\n\nDuring my final year of high school, my father was admitted to the hospital for open-heart surgery. I visited him several times between HSC exams. His surgery went well, and he returned home, but he remained weak and struggled to breathe. Around that time, one of my aunts suddenly died of a heart attack, which shocked everyone.\n\nWhile my father was recovering, I wanted to return to Dhaka for my studies, but he was too ill. My mother and I argued a lot. My mind was exhausted—I couldn’t rest, and I couldn’t focus on studying. After more conflict with my mother, I finally returned to Dhaka and joined a coaching center to prepare for the engineering admission exams.\n\nPreparing for those exams is hard as we know. At my uncle’s house, there were problems too. I was moved into the drawing room to study and sleep, and I couldn’t concentrate at all. I cried to my mother for help, but she didn’t respond—she was overwhelmed with my father’s illness. My uncle’s family, meanwhile, was celebrating the birth of a new child. While I was struggling and crying for help, there was laughter all around the house.\n\nEver since I was little, I loved machines. I always wanted to be an engineer. My mother knew this. I used to take apart my toys and gadgets to see how they worked—flashlights, radios, even a television. I started learning programming (Python) when I was in class nine. But my parents and relatives all wanted me to become a doctor. They kept pressuring me, and I couldn’t study properly.\n\nEventually, I took the engineering admission exam but couldn’t get a good rank. I wasn’t surprised, because I hadn’t been able to study properly through all that stress. Still, there was one more chance—a central exam for 24 universities. I studied hard for a month and did well in the test. But in the end, I failed because of corruption in the system. That's another story.\n\nNow I’m studying Computer Science and Engineering at a private university. In my first semester, I achieved a CGPA of 4.00 out of 4.00. I’m doing well academically, but I often feel depressed when I think about my life. I have no real family bond, I’m not in a top public university, I don’t earn any money, and I never received the love or care I needed from my parents.\n\nSometimes it feels like I have nothing.\n\n  \nThe story is mine, just written in plain English using chatgpt and some edits by me.",

        "body": "Japan exports anime and manga. Kpop is also popular in Bangladesh due to their soft power strategy. India has soft power in Bollywood. Pakistan also increasingly has soft power in Bangladesh due to their cricket team and many women wanting Pakistani man.\n\nWhy doesn’t Bangladesh develop soft power strategy. Given it is a clothing exporter powerhouse they can develop soft power in fashion like Japan did. Today, people go to France or Japan for shopping because the value is in the branding and design, not just production. I myself shopped in Japan and went to their stores like Uniqlo. When someone sees Tiger or Mizuno shoes they associate with Japan, and France with LVMH. There is no reason Bangladesh can’t develop aspirational clothing brands with the supply chain they have. Bangladesh in addition to West Bengal was the textile capital of world so tradition is there. \n\nSecond thing is cricket. Sport is a great way of showing soft power. Thats why Saudi is throwing money at football and the Qataris and Emiratis sponsor so many leagues. Today, people worship England because they have EPL. People love Spain because they have Barcelona and Real Madrid. Cricket is second most popular sport in the world so Bangladesh should develop its T20 League with a clear cultural EXPORTING strategy. Just like Manchester United have overseas fans and plays exhibition matches abroad Bangladesh teams such as Dhaka Capitals and Khulna Tigers should do the same and develop global following in cricket playing nations. \n\nThese are just two ideas I have. \n\n",

I want to build my career in research and/or teaching theoretical physics. \n\nSince there is basically zero opportunity for physics graduates in my country, I plan to move abroad for my career. To go through with my plan, I would need a fully funded scholarship for my Master's and PhD, as it's impossible for me to pay for education abroad.

I'll also have 4 years ahead of me before my Master's, so I think that's enough time to prepare myself. So basically I need help with the idea of a roadmap. Suggestions on scholarship programmes I could apply for is also appreciated. I'm very dedicated to this goal, so I'd be very grateful to anyone who helps out, thanks 🙏",

It showed me that when we treat animals kindly, they respond kindly too.\n\nSo, is it really fair to kill or torture animals like rats, cats, dogs, or that *beji*? It doesn’t even make sense — we don’t eat them. If you catch a rat, just release it somewhere far. And if street animals cause trouble, call DNCC or DSCC — that’s their job, not ours to harm them.",

But step inside, and the contrast is shocking. Officers sleep on rusty metal beds packed together inside suffocating rooms where even ceiling fans cannot be installed because the ceiling is too low. Case files are prepared sitting on beds because there are no desks. Bags are stacked on stairwells, walls are damp, the rooms are cramped, and pest control is a fantasy. Bedbugs bite them at night, mosquitoes during the day. Forty-two men share two toilets. There are no cleaners; officers clean the floors themselves after 12–14 hours of duty before they are allowed to rest.\n\n**The problem is not limited to Banani.** At Shah Ali Police Station in Mirpur 1, the situation is worse. There is no kitchen, so constables must eat outside, spending a quarter of their salary just to survive. There is not enough space to sleep. Some officers sleep on mosque verandas, some in community centers, and during busy weeks, many sleep on footpaths. Privacy doesn’t exist. A constable says he cannot even speak to his family over the phone at night because there is nowhere quiet to stand. There is also no rest area for reserve police officers—they sit outside for hours on chairs or rickshaws waiting for their shift to start.\n\n**These conditions are not just humiliating**—they affect policing. When a person is exhausted, living in heat, sleeping among insects, and working without rest, **can we really expect them to remain patient, professional, and morally firm every day?** We talk about police misconduct and corruption, but we never ask what happens when a system breaks a person down.",

Police stations cannot function with their current budget. Officers are sent to investigate murders with only Tk 6,000 from the government, when the **real cost is at least five times higher**. In one case, recovering a decomposed body in Ashulia cost Tk 9,100 before the investigation even began. The sub-inspector had to pay from his own pocket.\n\nBecause there isn’t enough allocation from the state, many police stations now survive through what officers openly describe as **“special funds.”** These funds are created through unofficial channels—*donations from businessmen, local political elites, and money taken from people who are desperate to get their cases moved forward or suspects released after bail. This doesn’t just create corruption*—**it makes corruption a requirement to keep police stations running**.\n\n**In Dhaka,** a police station receives Tk 40,000 a month as source money for operations, but spends over Tk 80,000 a month simply giving refreshments to daily visitors, many of whom are political figures. The station needs around Tk 1.5 lakh a month for basic supplies like paper, fuel, bulbs, toilet cleaners, and maintenance, but receives only a fraction of that every four months. Even detainees legally get Tk 30 per meal, but a basic meal today costs almost three times more. Police often end up feeding them from their own salaries to prevent starvation.\n\nVehicles are old and barely functional, making it impossible to respond to emergencies quickly. Fuel allocations are so low that officers sometimes rent private vehicles just to conduct operations. Officers admit the truth: they cannot meet public expectations because the system forces them to beg for funds informally. This is how integrity breaks—not always by personal greed, but by structural design.\n\n**Reform proposals already exist.** The Police Reform Commission has recommended more investigation funds, better operational budgets, a transparent audit system and direct funding for superintendents. But nothing changes if no one pays attention. ",

He was found the next day, October 23, in the Helipad area of Panchagarh Sadar Upazila, **chained to a tree by his leg and in a naked state**. Local residents discovered him and informed the police, who rescued him and admitted him to Panchagarh Adhunik Sadar Hospital.  \nMuhibullah claimed he was **abducted in an ambulance, tortured overnight**, and that he had been receiving **anonymous threat letters** before the incident. Some Islamic groups have protested in Panchagarh and demanded the arrest of those responsible.\n\n**When speaking to journalists** from his hospital bed, [Mufti Muhibullah provided a detailed account of his alleged abduction](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1D4osQWsEe/) and the motives behind it. He claimed that around 7 AM on October 22, while he was out for a walk after Fajr prayer, **five men** in an ambulance forced him inside by covering his face. He alleged that they then subjected him to **inhumane torture**, including being stripped, severely beaten with a water-filled bottle on his thighs, and having his beard shaved off. He stated the five men spoke **\"standard Bengali\"** but did not sound like Bangladeshis, and they threatened to harm all Islamic scholars.\n\nHe claimed his abduction was the culmination of **months of threats** delivered via anonymous letters. According to his statements and the First Information Report (FIR) filed later, these letters, allegedly from \"ISKCON terrorists,\" demanded that he preach in his mosque sermons:\n\n1. In favor of **Akhand Bharat** (Undivided India).\n2. In support of the release of **ISKCON leader Chinmoy Das**.\n3. Against **Islam-based political parties, BNP, and NCP**.\n4. A **fatwa** stating that there is no barrier to love between **Muslim girls and Hindu boys**.\n5. To **stop using the words Allah, Muhammad, and Islam** in the mosque.\n\nHe alleged the letters promised him a **large sum of money (crores of rupees)** if he complied, or threatened him and his family with death and harm if he refused.\n\nFollowing the widespread outcry over the alleged abduction and torture, particularly with Islamic groups in Panchagarh staging protests against ISKCON, an investigation was launched. \n\n**However,** subsequent findings have cast serious doubt on Mufti Muhibullah's claims, leading [police to place him under investigation](https://www.kalerkantho.com/online/national/2025/10/24/1596268). Several CCTV camera footage from the area and time he claimed to have been abducted show Muhibullah Miaji **walking quickly by himself**, but there is **no footage of anyone forcibly picking him up** or of an ambulance stopping to take him away.\n\nDespite claiming to have been tortured for nearly a day and a night, Muhibullah was observed to have **returned to normal life** and gave a speech to his congregation shortly after being released from the hospital. The content and language of the anonymous letters he produced also raised suspicions. Critics pointed out that the letters contain a mix of seemingly contradictory devotional terms (\"[Jagat Joyi Kalimata\" and \"Buddhadev](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BUY8f2pty/)\") and use words like **\"Adhikarik\"** which he himself noted is **not standard Bangladeshi official language**.\n\nAfter these inconsistencies came to light, Mufti Muhibullah was **interrogated by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)** and later admitted to a hospital in Dhaka, becoming unavailable for further comment.",

I'm brainwashed?? From the person who successfully convinced themselves Hindus are actively being rounded up and shot in the streets right now in Dhaka?\n\nIf I'm talking to a Bangladeshi Muslim, they often dismiss any fears/worries I have about the safety of Hindus in the country and just talk over me saying that Hindus in Bangladesh are safe and there's nothing for anyone ever to worry about as if that isn't a crazy exaggeration. If I speak too much about my worries, I'm called a BAL supporter and told to \"go back to India\". What's worse is some of the people who say this stuff are diaspora people who visited Bangladesh once when they were 7 and formed their opinions based on that. Who are you to say anything to me when you've never lived there and don't even speak Bangla?\n\nI'm exaggerating obviously(most of my Bangladeshi Muslim friends are great and many Indian Hindus I know are also normal people who don't believe the propaganda) but it feels so awful that I can't have a nuanced conversation with most people in real life about Bangladesh. \n\nCriticizing anything about NCP or the current political and social situation in the country gets you labelled a BAL supporter. Or braindead Hindutva people think bc I criticize one thing about the country I agree with their propaganda. Conversation about everything is so polarized. People blaming that rapist's actions on Hindus and using it as an excuse to be Hinduphobic as if though rapists don't come from all religions and types of people. Maybe they don't remember 2020 and 2015, but I do. And then there are the disgusting people who are defending that man's actions just because he's Hindu and people think Hindus can do no wrong. Equally terrible. \n\nSometimes, it genuinely feels like there's no normal, sane people left to have a conversation with. Sorry for the rant.",

By the Grace of God Almighty I've never had a major problem living my life here up until recently. \n\nDhaka is one hell of a depressing city. Massive population, unbearable traffic, pollutions and most importantly the cost of living. So I've decided to settle down in some place outside of Dhaka within 2031. I've been doing my own research, but I would really appreciate some suggestions.\n\nI do have some criterias to consider as I have to think about my children in the future. Based on priority:\n\n1. Language barrier \n2. People (acceptance towards outsiders)\n3. Education (decent is fine)\n4. Weather (Dhaka-like weather is fine)\n5. Location (out of city bounds and bonus if close to rivers or water bodies)\n\n\nI would very much appreciate the suggestions. Thank you. ",

However, many of the teachers there often seem to endorse Jamaat and its narratives. I also found out fairly recently that all two of the room execs that I knew were Shibir-spawns in their college-uni era\n\nDuring the recent Indo-Pak clash, one lecturer made some pretty explicit remarks, things like *“Pakistan is our brother nation,” “The fall of Islamabad means the fall of Dhaka,”* and *“India opposes Jamaat because it’s the only true patriotic force around.”* (-\\_-)  \nI strongly despised those comments. I brought it up in the student TG group to see how others felt, and it honestly sent shivers down my spine to see almost everyone supporting that lecturer’s stance. I went on a rant about Jamaat’s war crimes during ’71 and so on and soon after, the channel admin locked the chat and asked everyone to refrain from making political remarks.\n\nSo what do y'all make of **RETINA**?",

When I went to the library, I saw that the entire library was completely dark.WTF is this?How does an institution's library stay dark?

        "body": "\n\nHello everyone,\n\nI have been dealing with PCOS for a long time and have consulted several well-known gynecologists and endocrinologists in Dhaka. Unfortunately, most of them focus almost entirely on fertility and recommend trying for pregnancy which is not my priority right now.some doctors even don't listen what actually i want.\n\nMy main concerns are severe hair fall, persistent fatigue, difficulty concentrating, poor sleep, and skin issues. Despite following a healthy diet and exercising regularly, these problems continue to affect my daily life, productivity, and confidence.\n\nI am looking for a doctor who genuinely listens, understands the broader impact of PCOS beyond fertility,and provides practical advice for managing symptoms and improving overall health. I want guidance on how to balance hormones, reduce hair fall, improve sleep, enhance concentration, and manage skin issues effectively.\n\nIf anyone knows a gynecologist or endocrinologist in Dhaka who addresses PCOS comprehensively and doesn’t just focus on pregnancy, I would be very grateful for their recommendation.\n\nThank you so much for any hep.",

However, despite being born in Dhaka, I could never mix well with other English-medium students because of my inferiority complex. \n\n That’s one of the main reasons I never had any friends growing up. I rarely went out unless there was a specific reason, and my parents weren’t financially well-off enough to take me to different places or restaurants.\n\nNow that I’m 20, I feel completely clueless about restaurants, good tourist spots, or how to socialize, since I still don’t have any friends. I also lack good social and dressing skills. I’m still broke, but I don’t want to continue living such a lonely and miserable life. How can I improve in these areas?",

        "title": "Jobless for 10 months now.. Anyone else going through a similar struggle?",
        "body": "Hello everyone, or at least anyone that's reading this. I'm not sure how to structure this post properly, but it will probably read more like a rant than anything else. I'm just looking to kinda scream into the void.\n\nI'm 27 now. I got my first job at the age of 14, which was a creative writing job. I don't remember all too well, but it was a very underpaid job which was like 1200 words was $3 or something. Didn't really mind. Game is game.\n\nAnd that's where I started my freelancing journey. It probably needs to be emphasized that I didn't have a normal childhood, I was taken off education at an early age of 11, so I spent the rest of my time getting better at English, computers and just general internet literacy. I was lucky enough to have had a Pentium 4 with a 1 GB RAM computer that was handed down to me and I remember struggling so much to run even basic programs.. but it got me started and kept me going when I had nowhere else to go.\n\nFast forward a few years, I become more proficient at English and general tasks, and take on transcription and translation based jobs. While supporting what little I can for my little dysfunctional family (Mom, little brother, me). Due to constantly being under financial stress, we probably had to move homes I would say.. a total of 25-30 times until now? Anyway.. I guess I made what I had Infront of me as a career and this gave me a chance to work at Augmedix when I was 18. 25k job. Though I hadn't gotten in for their scribing project, it was a different project at the time which was an annotation project (code based transcription for AI training), but since it was a temporary experimental project it was shut off after 6 months, and me? Laid off. I didn't have the educational qualifications needed for their scribing department and it was a requirement.\n\nSo I set my gaze on online jobs and came across Amazon Mechanical Turk. With the help of a boro bhai, I was able to set up a computer in US that we remotely used to.. well, work on the tasks on the platform. The person in US did take a small cut, but it was negligible. I would make around 5-10 dollars a day by working for 12-14 hours which probably wasn't a whole lot, but it did keep me afloat for a long time pretty much until 2020.\n\nHonestly the pandemic era wasn't so bad for me, I barely used to go out anyway so it hadn't been much of a change for me, however what was a change was the influx of jobs in the market. A lot more work started to become available online and people weren't super focused on educational aspects, and this landed me a great job at Appen (now called CrowdGen). It was a Bengali transcription job, and seeing my effort and good English, I was quickly made into a project manager. Pay was $2.5 an hour. I was ecstatic. But good things never last too long. At least not in my case. By the time I was done paying all debts around us and just started experience \"shochcholota\" this project too was abruptly taken off at the 5 months mark.\n\nAfter this I fell back into the same place again and well, went back to Amazon Mechanical Turk. Earned whatever I could, and started picking up some video editing skills though my PC wasn't really capable of keeping up with it. I tried many call center jobs too in the middle of this, but I.. I don't know why, but I feel debilitated when it comes to working in call centers. I never fared well, no matter how many times I tried. I became deathly depressed to the point I would rather take my life instead of working in another call center.\n\n2022 rolls on, and due to the rise of AI, Amazon Mechanical Turk slowly started to lose all it's microtasks and this resulted in.. well, becoming homeless. Me, my little brother and my mom, we spent an entire month on the streets. We used to somehow spend nights in various hospital lobbies and benches, parks, even spent a few nights at Kamalapur station. Probably the darkest days of life and my family. My little brother fell off a rickshaw and ended up being hurt really badly to the point he couldn't move one of his leg. This prompted me to ask for help desperately from all the friends I knew. And one of them did help me out. His parents were incredibly kind souls and helped us out with almost 20k worth of money, not counting how they helped with food, clothes, and even mugs and plates. We managed to get a tiny \"chilekotha\" room for 8k a month, but even that felt so relieving. We finally had a place to stay after being on the streets for an entire month. I remember spending the new year (2023) on the roof of that house and feeling free.\n\nWhile living in this tiny place, I tried one last time to work in a call center where the pay was genuinely good at $3 per hour, but by the end of the second week I was throwing up everyday before my shift from anxiety, I was having constant panic breakdowns during calls, and.. yeah. I couldn't bring in the results they had hoped for, as well as my deteriorating call quality because we only had a single room. We actually had to go out to take a shower, the stove was in the exact same room we slept in, there was no way to wash the dishes other than taking it downstairs, it wasn't really a convenient place for a job that requires you to work at night in a quiet environment. But I still l wish I somehow could've rewired my brain to work at this place. Anyway.. So I went onto search more jobs and through the help of a mutual, I landed another job as a dispatcher for a US transportation company that operated from Bangladesh. Pay wasn't great, only 25k and I had to travel from Mohammadpur to Uttara to work, but.. it was still work.\n\nI actually had help from this r/Dhaka in 2023 where I explained my situation and how important it is for me to move to Uttara for my job after the horrible situation we had been in, and well, how our quality of life was in that chilekotha. I then moved to Uttara 18 (RUAP) with the help of the people from this sub as well as my boss from the workplace. It felt so amazing to live in a flat again, haha.\n\nSo.. I don't know what it is, whether I'm just a bad luck charm or my fate is just meant to be horrible, the company I mentioned I was working in? They had to downscale drastically after I was working 4 months there. In the beginning, the person who hired me did so because he couldn't handle the amount of work he had. We were handling the dispatching of 6 trucks. By the time the 4th month rolled around, one of the driver crashed and went out of business, the main contractor (4 trucks) got kicked out of his company and that turned into a single truck, and the other driver became less regular at his work due to health issues. So after cutting down my pay to 15k, he just couldn't afford keep me anymore so well, I got laid off once more at the 6th month.\n\nWe started getting pushed down by debts once more, 3 months of rent became due and that's when the best job until now came along. Actually I got my contract just 2 weeks prior to our civil war. It was a job from TelusDigital, but they were being subcontracted by Bytedance. Basically, we were working on the algorithm for TikTok Bangladesh. My first lakh-taka job. Though the process rigorous in itself, I still passed all of their insane tests with flying colors and even helped 3 other pass. I was the best performer in the job for 18 weeks straight. I was happier than I had ever been. 5$ per hour, 1 year contract, I was convinced I would get out of my situation as long as I diligently worked at this role.\n\nBut yup, you probably guessed it at this point, their AI/algorithm was ready at the 6 months point and they laid off everyone despite the 1 year contract. I couldn't really save any money either because I paid off the dues from before, and bought a fridge, some basic household items, and a laptop for my little brother. When I was laid off, I did pay 4 months of rent in advance, but we started struggling to have even basic meals. In this time, I tried whatever I could do, content creation, learning to code, making a SaaS, graphics design, nothing panned out. Luckily through the help of an old friend from Augmedix, my little brother (16) managed to find a job of his own. He is working in the making EMRs (Electronic medical records) for doctors in the US, and I couldn't be prouder of him. It pays only 20k, but he's doing what I haven't been able to in the past.. 9 months now.\n\nThe thing is that.. the debt has piled on so much now that we've been told by the house owner to move out next month if we can't pay off the dues. And I'm deathly scared of landing on the streets somehow again. My little brother doesn't earn enough for us to move, advance, and find another new place. I shouldn't even be relying on his income anyway, but I've probably applied to over hundreds of places now without anything panning out. Experience doesn't mean anything if you don't have an education.\n\nAnd I guess that's my TED talk, guys. My life and struggles so far has amounted to absolutely nothing. I'm just a nobody failure, and it honestly hurts. The only reason I don't give up is because I can't give up. My mother and my brother doesn't have anyone but me. I can't bear to see them suffer, my mother crying from hearing all the debters saying horrible shit, my brother not being able to sleep in peace because he feels like we'll become homeless again.. I am supposed to be their beacon of light, yet I'm just.. fucking useless.\n\nAh man.. Anyone going through a similar struggle of being jobless?",

Also there is a long distance trauma.She texted me for 1month non stop even after i aggressively told her to fuckoff.At last seeing so much desperated txt,i told her to meet me,then i will see.She came on march 27🙂She is an angel,literally my dream girl.We talked,before leaving i asked her to hold her hand,she gave away without a second thought. Btw that was my first ever sitting with a girl on a date.I fell for her.After some days she shared she had a relationship for 2years. Her bf cheated so she left.I asked her if she was physical,she said no,convinced me.I did let it go saying everyone has a past.\n\nWe were in deep love for 4months.She was sweet af,did everything possible for a gf in long distance. She supported me,cared for me on insane level.She texted gm every morning.Used to call me to wake me up for uni.Sometimes while talking she used to share her past relationship stories.I used to get insecured at that moments.I never had relationship before,all my life i was a decent, academically sound student.I was busy in studies.I also studies in one of the most reputed Engineering uni,also in top dept.Anyway,insecurity was silly.Like someone had her type feeling. On a night while talking, she suddenly started sharing her ex did this,playing victim while we were talking about us, our future.I was disturbed.Also about this time i get to know her frnd circle 🙂Most of her frnds were non virgin,almost everyone. Even some had abortion.I was in doubt how can she not have sex in 2years?She even justified things like \"sex krlei sarajibon eksathe thaka lagbe emon na\",\" sex to mistake\" while talking abt her frnds.After sharing id pass i went to her story archive saw her male frnds and past relationship stories.She went to movie date(one day she told me she knows wht people do in movie date),i saw her male frnds kole niye chobi tulse,she story dicche proudly🙂also so many male interactions,male frnds stories.I saw in her messenger she was telling a frnd she did visit her ex even after 1year of their brkup,she received gift from him.She dated multiple boys after brkup🙂\nI was shocked.I never expected this.Now i think all the desperation she showed was not love,was to bag a good guy,to get rid of her past.The insecurities that she had sex grew up so fast🙂i ended that relation forcefully, now im broke.I feel nothing about the world.I gave her my whole heart,i even fixed my marriage with her we planned everything 🙂I just cant sleep now.She was my first love,my only love.I had so many things to do in plan when she will come to dhaka.Everything is gone.What can i do🙂Should i go back to her or let this go.",

What do people cook for weddings, holidays, or big gatherings?\n\n5️⃣ How is food usually **served or eaten** — banana leaves, metal plates, clay dishes, hands? Is presentation important?\n\n6️⃣ What’s typical for **tea time** — are there unique snacks or sweets that differ from Indian mithai?\n\n7️⃣ Do some dishes or ingredients have **symbolic meanings** (good luck, family, love, home, etc.)?\n\n8️⃣ What are the **key cultural symbols** of Bangladesh — animals, plants, patterns, or colors that carry special meaning?  \n(I came across an idea that **a lizard is a guardian of the home** — is that true?)\n\n9️⃣ Are there **traditional patterns, ornaments, or crafts** that often appear in food culture — like embroidery, textiles, or tableware?\n\n1️⃣0️⃣ What’s the general **attitude toward food** — is it more about family, comfort, spirituality, street culture, or just the joy of flavor?\n\n1️⃣1️⃣ What does a **daytime street food market** feel like — sounds, smells, colors, chaos? How would you describe the atmosphere?\n\n1️⃣2️⃣ What does **hospitality** mean in Bangladeshi culture? Are there sayings, customs, or gestures tied to sharing food?\n\n1️⃣3️⃣ Do you know any **restaurants, cafés, food trucks, or delivery places** that serve *real Bangladeshi food* outside Bangladesh — especially in Russia or Europe?\n\n1️⃣4️⃣ If you’ve been there — **what dish or flavor stuck with you the most**, and why?\n\n1️⃣5️⃣ And lastly — **what feeling do you associate with Bangladeshi food?**  \nIs it comfort, heat, noise, family, chaos, or something else entirely?\n\n\n\n💬 Any stories, photos, memories, or links will be a huge help for my research.  \nThank you so much in advance for sharing your experience ❤️",

        "body": "I want to share an unpleasant experience my mother and I faced on our Emirates flight from Dhaka to the Dubai. What was supposed to be a smooth five-hour journey turned into a distressing experience because of one extremely rude and disrespectful passenger.\n\nAs soon as I boarded, I placed my two hand luggage bags in the overhead compartment. Immediately, a man started shouting at me, saying things like:\n\n“Why are you putting your bag on my side? Where will I put mine?”\n\nI calmly explained that there was enough space in the middle compartment and even offered to help him with his bag. Instead of accepting help, he continued yelling and refused to listen.\n\nAt first, I ignored his behaviour, but it quickly escalated. He aggressively removed my luggage from the compartment without my consent and shockingly began insulting my mother with disgusting, sexist language.\n\nAt that point, I stood up and confronted him — no one should ever tolerate such disrespect, especially towards women. Thankfully, the cabin crew and nearby passengers intervened before the situation got worse.\n\nThe Emirates crew handled the issue professionally and supported us throughout. We filed an official complaint so that the airline could keep a record of his behaviour for future flights.\n\nThis post isn’t just about one rude passenger — it’s about the bigger issue of misogyny, aggression, and lack of respect that too often goes unchecked, especially on routes from South Asia. As frequent flyers, my mother and I believe no one should have to endure such verbal abuse in a civilised setting.\n\nI hope airlines continue to take stronger action to protect passengers — especially women — from harassment and verbal violence on flights Emirates",

But I always see India claiming it as Indian, not South Asian or from the Indian subcontinent. Why is that?”\n\nI made that post because I’d seen a few videos where Indians were claiming Muslin as an Indian fabric.\n\nFor those who don’t know, Muslin is a fabric that originated in Dhaka. It’s extremely fine, almost see-through, and so delicate that an entire saree can pass through a ring.\n\nSo a in India a list was made of fabrics \nAnd muslin was there .\n\n\n\nAnd I realized this isn't the first time or the first person who had done this \n\nThen I saw another post about saree being a purly indian garment \n\n\n\nOk so in the comment section of my post \n\n\nTheir logic was that since Bangladesh was founded in 1971, something thousands of years old couldn’t possibly belong to Bangladesh.\n\nSo I replied, “By that logic, nothing belongs to India either, since India was formed in 1947.”\n\nThat’s when they became enraged. They started saying things like “Bangladesh destroyed itself,” “it’s a failed state,” and other disrespectful comments. Many used very offensive language.\n\nBasically, they don’t follow their own logic. To them, anything desi automatically belongs to India.\n\nBefore today, I used to think India wasn’t that bad, and that we all belonged to the same subcontinent. I didn’t understand the hate.\n\nBut now, I do.\n\nBefore this experience, I only knew a few Indians — my friends — and I mistakenly thought all Indians were like them.\n\nIndians are just a bunch of entitled idiots (obviously there are some exceptions)\n",

About a week ago, the retailer called to say the battery had been serviced and returned from the manufacturer, and that it would be delivered to Sylhet on Saturday or Sunday. Unfortunately, no delivery was made. Since then, they’ve stopped responding — they don’t reply on WhatsApp, they cancel calls, and I think they may have even blocked me.\n\nI work abroad, so I can’t visit the shop myself. My relative called them, they initially spoke to him but now they cancel his calls.  I could ask someone to visit the shop on my behalf, but it would mean a long trip from Sylhet to Dhaka.\n\nWhat are my options here? Has anyone experienced something similar, or can suggest the best way to deal with this? I’m worried they may just ignore us now and avoid delivering the product altogether.\n\nThank you.",

I had friends back in my days. But slowly with the time, I kinda lost all of my friends. All of my friends are in different cities and some are not even in this country. I lost contact with some.\n\nI don't have a girlfriend, and I never had one. Although there is this girl I chat daily (i know her irl), but recently some of her behaviors really got under my skin and I think I am done with that part and I do regret about that chapter. I wish I never started talking to her. \n\nI do go out on tours and meet my with friends whenever it's possible. But it's like once in a while.  \n\nI earn decent. But now I am very empty inside. I feel sorry for me. I feel how miserable I am. On working days, it doesn't hunt me much. But I feel like crying on weekends. It's taking a toll on me. All I do is play video games, and browse social medias and random forums. But I cannot keep living like this. Every weekend I wanna go out and hangout with friends. But there's no one absolutely. And it's killing me inside. I'm losing my sanity. I just keep praying to get done with weekends as soon as possible. Is it a part of growing up? Is it just me or everyone else out there? Am I too weak? I am clueless, helpless and pissed. I don't even know how to express this thing. This is a very weird unpleasant sad feeling. I wish to cry sometimes and I don't even know how to cry. And I don't even know what to cry for. I don't know this weird super sad feeling. I feel like dying.",

        "title": "Is depression something to brag about???",
        "body": "I don’t know why I always end up getting this type of tutor.\nSo, I have a tutor from (x)UET, and he is such a nerd. And I like nerds. He reads a lot of books, prays regularly. Although I’m not religious myself, devoted people seem admirable. And he was one of those people. His teaching is also a solid 9/10. He’s also easy to have a conversation with.\n\nBut recently, one conversation with him left me stunned.\nLet me tell you what it was.\n\nOk,so he mentioned a few times before that he was diagnosed with depression and several other mental disorders. Recently, a boy in our area attempted suicide and didn’t survive. That boy actually got into the same (x)UET last year. Everyone said it happened due to academic pressure. And my tutor made a comment like, “Since he chose this, he doesn’t deserve to live either.” His words already felt so wrong.\n\nBut then what he said next shocked me even more. He said :“Wasn’t I depressed? Don’t I know how it feels? I didn’t want to live either. I wanted to die too. But I survived, didn’t I? Then why couldn’t he?”\n\nSo now we’re comparing sadness and depression? Our struggles? What is even left to compare?\nLike, if you truly went through something like that, how can you judge him for not being able to overcome it? Shouldn’t he show sympathy rather than competing with someone who has already died?\n\nI tried to argue a little, but it felt like he was only listening just to prove me wrong instead of actually listening. Like, don’t we know the social context of mental health in our country? The lack of awareness, family stigma, limited help, poverty? How can an educated person like him say something like that without thinking twice?\n\nAfter that, I looked back at all of our conversations outside of study. And I realized he had used his depression to downplay others’ suffering many times already. Like when my HSC result came out and I missed GPA-5. He asked me why it happened, and I said I couldn’t study properly because my mother died in the first year of HSC, then my aunt who looked after me also died in the second year, and my brother left my father and me with a lot of debt. I was simply not in a position to study for the majority of the time.\n\nHe said, “So? Everyone has problems. They still scored better than you. Even I had depression. You’re nothing special.”\n\nLike… just because I’m not clinically diagnosed with depression doesn’t mean my struggle is any less than yours.\n\nAnd he is also obsessed with “women’s purity.” One time I mentioned that I wanted to be a nurse as a child. And he said it’s better that I changed that dream because a nurse might have to stay in the hospital at night with male doctors. You know what he meant. So when he hears “nurse,” the first thing that comes to his mind is questioning her character for doing her job. But why doesn’t he apply that same logic to male doctors?🤷‍♀️\n\nOh, and he also asked me once how long I’ve been using a personal phone. When I said I got mine three years ago, his reaction was like 😮. Then he asked if my father ever checks my phone. You should’ve seen his face when I said “never.” He couldn’t believe that I was given so much freedom. In his eyes, my father did horrible parenting. Then he said his sister, who is a year older than me, still doesn’t have a personal mobile. She’s only allowed to use his phone or their mother’s. আবার বলে ফোন হাতে পেলে নাকি মেয়েরা খারাপ হয়ে যায়, প্রেম করতে শুরু করে. Which is why she isn’t allowed any privacy at all.\n\nAnother time when i argued over his philosophy of of how a woman should always be a step bellow a man. He called beshi bojha maya.he also said ato beshi mayader naki kopale dukho ache.\n\nHe’s just another Bangladeshi man. Like.. what did I even expect.\nTo think my selective bias led me to not see any of this. I was even thinking of setting him up with my cousin (she had a crush on him).\n\nI used to think people who read books must be super open-minded. But that’s not the case, it seems. Just reading doesn’t improve someone’s consciousness or automatically make someone a better person.\n\nAsshole. I just want to get rid of him quickly. ",

Thanks in advance.\n\n  \nI also used GPT to refine this post so that I can clearly explain my situation.\\*",

        "body": "After the earthquakes that hit Bangladesh in the last 2 days News outlets have started over exaggerating the threat. They are capitalizing on people's fear. I saw one outlet literally saying there can be magnitude 9 earthquakes in Bangladesh. First of all this is total vogus. Bangladesh does not have the type of subduction zone needed for magnitude 9 earthquakes. So it is highly unlikely to be hit by a mag 9 earthquake. Now about today's earthquake. After any 5-6 magnitude earthquake aftershocks are normal. 2-10 aftershocks in the first 24–72 hours is common. Now it's not that there isn't any risk of earthquake anymore. There's still a chance to be hit by a big earthquake. Research says there can be maximum 7.5-8 mag earthquake in this zone. So now it's not the time to get scared. We need to be prepared for earthquake. We need to make preparation. Mark places you can take shelter during earthquakes(hard tables,beds), keep a bag ready with important papers, keep your shoes/sandles out because there can be debris in worst case scenarios, keep a bag ready with dry food and water and Always keep faith in your god and let's pray for each other's safety.

There's multiple problems like forward head, pelvic tilt, collapsed foot arch etc. Day to day activities have become very difficult to perform and any sort of neck or spine movement makes things worse.\n\nHas anyone gone through this? Is there a reliable place and process to treat it?",

My goal is to finish the entire exam process (all subjects) and pass the board exam within approximately 12 months.\nMy Background &amp; Constraints:\nGoal: Complete HSC in 1 year.\nPreferred Group: Science is ideal, but I am prepared to switch to Humanities or Commerce if that group offers a more realistic path for a 1-year completion.\nEducation Gap: I have a significant 4-year break since passing Class 10 (SSC/equivalent). 2024-2025 batch from a vocational school.\nWork Schedule: This is the biggest challenge. I work a fixed night shift from 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM. I am only available for classes/studying during the daytime/morning.\nGroup Recommendation: Based on my time constraint, would Commerce or Humanities be a more manageable syllabus to complete in 1 year compared to Science?\n\nAlso I need some career advice as well I wanted to be a software engineer or at least a computer science background, it's my passion. But I don't think I can do it with commerce or humanities\nBut anyways thanks",

I always reach on time and receive the shift properly, even on days when I don’t even get a chance to eat. But many of my colleagues come late with excuses, and since we have no digital attendance system, entry/exit time isn’t properly monitored. Because of that, I often end up doing extra time after my shift is already over. It’s exhausting, and I don’t know if I should “accept it as normal” or speak up — but it’s bothering me a lot.\n\nI hired someone to cook for me so I can manage my time better, but most of the time she doesn’t prepare food on time. So I often go to work without eating.\n\nMy family situation adds more weight. My father is always in debt somehow. My mother sold her own land multiple times to clear it. A few years ago I also took a bank loan to pay off his debt — but again he’s in debt. I almost carry all of my parents’ expenses, but still I don’t get the support, understanding, or stability I need from them.\n\nOn top of everything, I’m not a social person. I struggle to connect with people, so I often feel lonely and frustrated. And the environment around me doesn’t help much either.\n\nI don’t know if others feel this way, but my life constantly feels messed up. I’m trying, but some days it just becomes too much.",

Everyone online makes it look so simple: “start a store,” “learn marketing,” “just be consistent,” but when you’re actually sitting down trying to understand everything step by step… it hits different.\n\nI’m 21, trying to figure out my life, trying to build something real. But every time I start learning, I feel overwhelmed. Too many paths, too much information, and no one to guide me in real life. I feel like I’m fighting my own thoughts half the time, like I want to improve, I want to build a business, but I don’t even know where to start anymore.\n\nIf anyone else struggled like this in the beginning, how did you push through? How did you stay focused and actually understand things instead of just getting lost in information?\n\nAny advice would help. I just want to learn the right way and build something meaningful.",

        "body": "Okay so due to some personal reasons, I hold resentment and grudges against my parents. I don't like it at all how they don't let me have privacy and barge in whenever they want and tell me to do stuffs. It's like their regular thing to disturb me. Now since I can't control myself when I get annoyed I tend to raise my voice a lot or shout at them. And I behave very rudely when they barge in when I'm studying. My focus tends to get ruined at the smallest of sounds so it's so so hard for me to get my focus back when they barge in and talk to me and thus I get angry and my first tendency is to shout. I can't help it since I struggle a lot to get my focus back once it's Lost. Now the thing is I think is might be one of the major reasons Allah isn't accepting my duas. I want to control this reaction of mine no matter how much struggle or anger it brings. Any suggestions how to stop this response? They disturb me frequently specially my father like barges in my room 6-7 times an hour when he's at home. And no telling him no doesn't work. Ofc it doesn't. Give me suggestions ",

        "body": "Ok, feel like I should give some context as to explain my situation first.\nI graduated from Marketing dept at a public uni back in 2017. CGPA was 3.07 on a 4.0 scale.\nAfter a while, I joined as a Marketing Researcher (part time) at a startup. \nAfter 6 months, I joined as a full time digital marketing co-ordinator, where the roles included: digital media content planning, writing, designing, social media &amp; website handling etc. Worked for a year or so, then the company shut down. \nIt was around 2021 &amp; I was unemployed again. Never really finding a good match &amp; frustrated with Covid &amp; private sector situation, I then started prepping for gov jobs. \nLong story short, there’s been around 3-4 years of gap here &amp; there, then I had to switch my path.\nI’ve been working as an assistant school teacher at a gov primary school for 3 years now.\nRecently attended IELTS, score came out 8.0.\n\nI’m 30F, unmarried. I know I’m late but I still want to settle down somewhere safer for a single woman. My budget is mid, so I’ll probably need some scholarships/waivers.\nI would like to go to Canada/Australia/USA. But, I’m afraid I’d probably be rejected amidst all the crazy rigid rules. Or even if I do make it somehow, maybe I will be kicked out without a PR. \nAccording to you, which country seems like the best option right now?\nAnd I’m also really, really confused about what course &amp; career path should I go for; after going through such a chaotic track. I don’t really hate teaching as a profession, but it seems criminally under-appreciated (besides being majorly brain-rotting). I’m thinking how it’d be to do M.Ed abroad and become a teacher there (definitely not as easy as here.) \nKinda scared about reuniting with Marketing/Business though, with the rapid growth in big data, AI, AGI &amp; such. I remember I enjoyed studying subjects like Economics, Statistics, IMC and Consumer Behaviour. What’re some  viable course options relevant to any of these that can give you sustainable leverage (demand wise) in the job market &amp; maybe help getting PR too? Help a sis out please, TYSM.",

The issue is a cat came out of nowhere in my room and staying for last 2 days. I don't know what to feed him. I just gave him my leftover chicken and fish. But it doesn't eat rice. I don't even know where does it poops. Can't even throw it away, it comes over and over again. I thought of buying some cat foods but I can't afford them. I can even barely manage my own breakfast. Suggest me what should I do? I'm even scared about diphtheria if somehow it gives me the disease by touching my food or water. Let me know what should I do, please. ",

I have given up on studying or doing smtg productive. Hell I dont even shower or organise my room or EAT. Bc all I care about is getting dopamine from imagining things. There's nothing that brings me happiness except for making scenarios in my head. This has been goin on for over 15 years (i'm 20). \n\nI have been to this certain psychiatrist in my city twice, he did not give me an exact plan to my problem. He gave me antidepressants and advised me how unrealistic this is and how this is draining my life and I totally understand that. But i cannot logic my way out of MD. the sole reason I went there was bc i know what is wrong with me and i needed direction. If you look up MD, it is a literal addiction, similar to drugs. Only that it comes w endless access. I dont only want to imagine myself having my dream life while being a mess in real life. I might be visiting dhaka soon. I'll need someone to  help me out with this. If yk a good psychiatrist experienced in addiction, do tell. I know i'm a mess, that's why i need a way out. Please help me. ",

But damn being a woman in her late 20s in a country like bangladesh feels like a curse. We are viewed as undesirable. You feel this immense pressure from your family, society to sort things out asap and get married and have bunch of kids. Because that's the only goal in a woman's life.\n\nEven if you do all of that I have seen that they are still depressed and sad most of the time. Aside from family and societal expectations, there is your own personal issues. Most of you probably haven't achieved everything you wanted to. I mean growing up you have a picture in your mind how your adult life is going to be. And when you are that adult and your life doesn't turn out how you wanted you feel like you let down your younger self. I am now older, and even more depressed. It feels like my future is dark. That my life is not going anywhere. And I will be stuck in a broken marriage where I will be forced to have children.\n\nI am sure we have our fears but why does your late 20s feel like this? I mean shouldn't we have figured out life by now? Achieved all our goals and settle. Instead I can't settle because to me settling looks like accepting defeat. That I lost to achieve my goals. And why do I always feel tired and drained. I mean even when I was in university I had to walk for 30 minutes to get to my classes and then travel 2 hours home I would still have energy to do things. Now, even weekends feel like draining. Why does it feel like everything is falling apart? Like where is the logic?",

Many people here act very double-faced—pretending to be friendly on the surface but being toxic, judgmental, or fake behind the scenes. What confuses me even more is that they all somehow stay together in groups, even though they clearly don’t like each other.\n\nI’m trying to focus on myself, my studies, and my growth, but the environment sometimes gets heavy. I don’t want to isolate myself completely, but I also don’t want to get dragged into drama, competition, or fake friendships.\n\nFor those who have been through similar university environments:\nHow did you protect your peace and maintain your mental health?\nHow do you deal with ‘double-faced’ or toxic people while still surviving socially on campus?",

Does that mean women who are infertile will be neglected? They can't even give proper reference to this. Also women are allowed to jobs in Islam even Bibi Khadiza also did business at that time. But they'll be saying that women's job is only to serve their husbands and children and to stay at home. Don't they know the history of Islam? I bet they do but they don’t want to admit the rights of women. Also one of the aunt saw me going to school wearing uniform and then she complained to my mother saying why I don’t wear Burkha above the uniform. Duh? I'm literally going to school and I have a scarf wrapped around my head. They said how I'm seducing those street men wearing only uniform and not burkha... And whenever a 6 months old get SA'd, they complain about her clothes,like bro she's a kid,she just came to the world.

        "body": "Today a very annoying thing happened with me. So I am student of college and I carry my phone with me as I live very far and get bored on the way to college everyday and carrying a phone also allows me to contact my parents at any certain time. So for my daily commute I take public transport as it is more cheap than the college bus. So today as usual i was on my way back and had my earbuds on my ear and was listening to some song and this random person starts asking me Is my phone allowed in college and I said no it's not allowed I just carry it and obviously I don't go and wave it around my teacher's face, almost 70% of the students carry their own phone. Then he started telling me that if majority people started doing wrong things which are illegal won't be legal. And I said why do you think it's illegal, he says phone has a bad influence over people and people get easily attracted to bad things but I said that's not true. I believe it's in someone's nature, if they wanna do something wrong no amount of strictness can stop them and if someone wants to do something right no amount of bad influence can affect them. But that person kept going on and on about how it's a bad thing and I was getting pissed at this point, I said your thinking is wrong and clearly your from a small town that's why you're thinking is also small but he kept saying it's not wrong and in their times on the institution gate they used to check bags then let them enter but I said your time was different. We are not breaking any major disciplinary act, we have phone we keep it in our bag don't use it in the middle of class not disturbing anyone anyhow with my phone only use it on my way how am I doing something wrong. He's saying no I lived in Dhaka for last four years, I am in Dhaka city college, I kept telling him that you are not right and I am not obligated to answer you but he's saying I am giving a right advice to you because apparently using a earbuds wearing a uniform leaves some kind of bad mark to the name of students according to him. He wasted my time and made my ear bleed with his nonsense.\n\nHonestly I don't think phone is breaking any kind of discipline and nowadays teacher are aware that everyone has phones but they don't say anything cause somewhere they also understand some people need it as they need to contact their parents alot and by carrying it we are not doing anything wrong. Yea if someone uses it in the middle of class or exam it's wrong but if it's only kept in bag and only used outside educational institution I don't think it's bad any how and EM schools allow phones and alot of colleges started allowing phone to. Teacher coming to classes and for no reason checking bag and taking a phone should not be encouraged. And the random guy I met has very regressive thoughts and I think people like him are the reason our country is regressing and not progressing, but yea do let me know what you guys think",

        "title": "Dhaka English Medium Schools: Playgroup Admission Info",
        "body": "\nI have collected data on the admission costs and monthly tuition fees for PLAYGROUP at several well-known English Medium schools in Dhaka. Since the cost and fee structures for most of these schools are not publicly available, I am sharing this information to help other parents of young children.\n\nBased on the costs, these schools can be generally categorized into three tiers. Schools in the Budget-Conscious Category typically have tuition fees ranging from 8k-12k per month. These include Averroes, Playpen, Hurdco, Canadian Maple, Maple Leaf, Southbreeze, Manarat, BIT etc. You should expect to pay a one-time admission fee of between 100k and 150k during enrollment.\n\nI am calling the next category of schools Mid-Range (though sounds insane considering the cost). These schools are generally regarded as some of the best English Medium schools in Dhaka, with monthly fees between 17k and 25k. The schools in this tier are Sunbeams, Sunnydale, Glenrich (DPS STS), Sir John Wilson, Scholastica, Mastermind, International Hope, Chittagong Grammar, Singapore Kinderland etc. The initial admission costs for these schools are approximately 170k to 250k.\n\nAbove the mid-range are the more Premium Category schools. Like Springdale: Annual Tuition Fee 400K, AUSIS: Annual Tuition Fee 460K, Aga Khan: Annual Tuition Fees 650K. Admission costs of these schools are around 300k-400k.\n\nFinally, there are two God Tier international schools with fees quoted in USD: For ISD (International School Dhaka), the Admission Cost is approx. $9,000 and the Annual Tuition Fee is approx. $7,000, making the total cost for the first year around $16,000. For AISD (American International School Dhaka), the Admission Cost is $17,500 and the Annual Tuition Fees are $17,500. The total cost for the first year alone is approximately $35,000, which is close to 44 lac BDT.\n\nIt is worth noting that the one-time Admission Cost is often equal to the school's Annual Tuition Fees. Additionally, parents typically incur an additional 15% to 20% in other expenses on top of the stated tuition fees, covering costs like books, stationery, extracurricular activities etc except transportation. Transportation would cost extra 8k-10k per month.\n\nCurrently, the most competitive admission processes are found at Sunbeams, Sunnydale, and Sir John Wilson. Since the academic session starts in July for these schools, the admission process for Playgroup typically begins in August of the previous year. Child needs be within 3-4 years old on 1st July for Playgroup Admission.\n",

I also emailed them, and they confirmed the same thing. But I’m still lowkey unsure because almost every other university in Bangladesh requires physics or at least some science subjects for architecture.\n\nCan anyone confirm why BRAC is different here?

The entire world is calling this case a *miscarriage of justice*. The world says this case will remain an example of a farce in the name of justice. Police may apply “proportionate force’’ to protect state property and safeguard the lives and property of citizens. That is still happening—perhaps even excessively.\n\nIn Gopalganj, not a single police or army member was even slightly injured, yet during a political program there, 5–6 people were killed by the excessive force used by the current Yunus government. This is genocide.\n\nMeanwhile, from BTV, metro rail, Setu Bhaban, toll plazas to across the entire country, hundreds of businesses and vehicles were destroyed; prisons were attacked and militants–terrorists were freed. Police officers were beaten and hung. In response, actions taken in self-defense have now been turned into fabricated, baseless accusations to stage executions. Yet this makeshift “lawyer” claims no law was violated. Time will tell what was lawful and what was not.\n\nThose who are helping this illegal government and their militant allies will be punished under the existing laws of Bangladesh. That will be done through an “expedited” trial. There is nothing left to prove—everything is already proven.\n\n[Source](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1AHkQM7e2H/)",

        "body": "I’m a 22M and I’ve never been in a relationship. It’s not because I get rejected — I honestly never felt interested in casual dating, hookups, or “timepass” relationships. I’m still a virgin, and for me it has always been about waiting for someone who fits the kind of life I want to build.\n\nThe issue is… I haven’t found anyone in my “zone.”  \nBy that, I mean someone mature, emotionally stable, not into unnecessary drama, and not obsessed with gossip, trends, or whatever goes viral. I want someone with strong morals and ethics, someone intelligent, someone who loves sincerely and not performatively.\n\nIdeally she’d be creative (art, music, anything she’s passionate about), grounded in real life instead of feeding her mind with social media garbage, proactive instead of constantly complaining, and able to handle small issues without turning them into big dramas.\n\nI also prefer someone who dresses decently (not burkha, not revealing outfits — just simple and modest). Someone who shares a similar lifestyle and values. And yes, I prefer someone who is a virgin as well — not because of judgment, but because that’s what aligns with my personal values and the type of relationship I want.\n\nBut when I look at modern dating culture, I feel discouraged. Many people today seem focused on attention-seeking, casual relationships, smoking/drinking, appearances, or trends rather than values, sincerity, and emotional maturity. It makes me feel like maybe I’ll stay single forever rather than enter a relationship that feels fake, forced, or incompatible.\n\nI’m not a “religious scholar” type person. I’m just a normal guy — a tech nerd, not fully introverted or extroverted, someone who tries to pray, tries to learn Islam deeply, and tries to be a better human. I want a partner with a similar mindset — someone moral, mature, creative, and emotionally balanced.\n\nWhenever I see couples or see beautiful women’s items like dresses, watches, or accessories in Bashundhara or Jamuna, I wish I had someone to buy these things for. That feeling hits me every time.\n\nSo my question is: **Is it genuinely this hard to find someone like this today?**  \nI’m not rushing, I’m not obsessed — I just wonder if such people are rare or if I’m simply looking in the wrong places.",

Hong Kong - historically has been a massive opposition. \n\nThe biggest glaring issue is obviously the defense. That was an atrocious performance. I don't get the logic behind playing Saad Uddin at centre of defence but oh well, neither do I understand not playing Tapu Barman. Individual errors cost us this match.\n\nThere's also the ridiculous starting lineup - Mohammed Fahim and Mohammed Sohel Rana - really? This is obviously a glaring case of the infamous Bashundhara syndicate. Bashundhara will be the death of Bangladesh football. Fahim did absolutely nothing the entire match, he left the entire left flank absolutely wide open. Mohammed Sohel Rana is not nearly sophisticated player enough to start ahead of players like Shamit Shome or experienced players such as Jamal Bhuiyan. Utter ridiculous.\n\nWith all that being said, I'm choosing to be positive, and when looking at the positives of this game - if we can iron out the issues in defence. I'd say we are a decent team.",

        "body": "Please read the entire thing. I can guarantee it will help you understand our politics.\n\nDon’t skim :)\n\n——\n\nGuys I go to DU and I can tell you &lt;10% of the student base does Jamat or relates anyway to the Rajakar narrative.\n\nJamaat won DUCSU simply because:\n\n1) They acted decently and made sure to be helpful and accessible to everyone. They set up water filters at every hall - a basic thing which the DU authorities couldn’t care to provide. Granted that they had insane funding compared to BNP.\n\n2) They picked an active sommonoyok like Sadik Kayem who graduated first of his class during his Masters. \nMeanwhile BNP’s VP pick wasn’t particularly active during the July Revolution and was known more by outsiders than the students.\n\n3) Shibir moved away from its extremist elements. They had a non-hijabi girl on their panel amongst other girls and boys. CU’s panel even has Hindu candidates. (This may’ve been done for show but it helped for people to see that everyone can be a part of them if they’re qualified.)\n\n4) (IMPORTANTLY) BNP copied BAL’s strategy of culture war centering that honestly I think this generation is over with. It wanted to paint Jamaat as pro-Pakistani and by doing so they unwittingly made themselves look pro-Indian. They brought that ghastly “__ chamra tule nebo amra” slogan in Shahbag. They arranged these big show-offy campus michils with a bunch of their shanda-pandas aka outsiders and caused a nuisance in the campus.\n\nAfter the election, Shibir installed sanitary napkin vending machine in 5 academic buildings (these are *general* places mind you) while all BNP did was start a rumor that it was funded by a Pakistani aid group with the same name.\n\nIt’s undeniable that July Revolution wasn’t just about bringing down Hasina but also her sponsors in Delhi. Inevitably, the current sentiments of the younger populace are extremely anti-Indian atm, and it wasn’t a good strategy for BNP to play that card.\n\n—-\n\nJust to conclude, I think BNP needs to be more in touch with what the public wants. BD public is super emotional and frankly very short-sighted but you still need their votes. And the only way to do that is to match their vibes - even if you don’t follow through with every demand they ask for after winning (no politician ever does).\n\nI initially studied at an English Medium school before coming to DU. Whenever I hear Tarique speak, he sounds exactly like my school classmates who spent their lives in ring elite bubbles and are very very detached with the problems the country’s middle class are facing. \n\nIn a country with the lowest CFAR rate and one of the highest inflation rates, he’s busy talking about setting an animal rights welfare ministry. His party leaders are making the same mistake in bringing back cultural narratives about the Muktijoddha.\n\nThey just don’t understand that in a land where \n a vast segment of the populace struggles to get 2 meals a day, voting based on animal rights or what happened 50 years ago is a luxury. People are concerned for what you can do for them NOW.\n\nThey are willing to absolve Jamat from its past sins if it means starting fresh on a new hope of corruption-free politics. Since Jamat has no history in ruling, they have less baggage to maintain. \n\nIf BNP doesn’t course correct, we might end up with a Jamat gov next year.\n\nI’m happy to answer any questions or hear of any criticisms.

Right wing activists are seeing this as a massive win, probably the first milestone in post Hasina Bangladesh that marks the downfall of liberalism, while the left finds the event as the beginning of erasing 1971 from our national spirit.\n\nOne thing is clear by now- judiciary was corrupt during the previous regime. There are numerous examples of forced testimonies against alleged war criminals. The waters have been muddied so much that at this point, nothing can solidly convince a rational person.\n\nYet the right is trying to say that the judiciary is perfect now. How can we claim that? Can we really say that the state went through major reforms after 5 August? Every day we hear news about political parties influencing the system, yet we are to believe that the judicial system is above corruption now.\n\nThere is nothing we can do now, another Shahbag can't be formed without state support, nor that it should form.

        "body": "Z9\n---\n\"Bashundhara Multi Steel Industries has been accused of forging a letter in the name of the Ministry of Shipping to allegedly evade Tk 50 crore in port rental fees,\"—this headline was published today in various media outlets. But in reality, was any letter actually forged? The answer is \"no.\" No letter was forged at all; the story of a forged letter was fabricated by the ministry when they found no other way out.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, a senior bureaucrat of the interim government sent me the attached letter issued on May 12. He said that permission had been granted for the release of Bashundhara Group's goods by waiving 60% of nearly Tk 100 crore in store rent/port charges. He also informed me that a significant transaction was involved in this \"waiver\" process, with the involvement of the son of a key figure in the interim government and some officials.\n\nI tried to verify the letter that very day, but somehow this verification attempt was leaked to the ministry. And then a storm broke loose! The people involved in the corruption began aggressively trying to cover up the issue. They started to spread the claim that the issued letter was “forged,” and yesterday, when Bashundhara Group officials went to release the goods, a dramatic situation unfolded, including arrests.\n\nI began investigating whether the letter was indeed forged. Interestingly, the clue was inside the letter itself—it referenced two other letters. I tracked down those letters.\n\nBoth letters exist, and the signatories listed in the copies have confirmed their authenticity. On condition of anonymity, port officials informed me that the ministry had been pressuring the port for months to resolve the matter. Take a look at the letter issued on January 5, 2025. You’ll see that the ministry, through Deputy Secretary Nazrul Islam Azad, instructed the Chattogram Port Chairman to respond with an opinion within three days.\n\nSo now, will the Ministry of Shipping still claim that the 60% waiver letter is fake? And would an extremely shrewd industrial group like Bashundhara prepare to release their goods at the port based on a forged letter without any prior understanding or agreement?\"\n",

Recently, the father of interim government student advisor Asif Mahmud was exposed for having a contractor's license, which has heightened my concerns about corruption.\n\nIt's been over half a year since the uprising, and I'm staring to feel disappointed that some young people seem to have forgotten their original goals. I've been following some analyses from NCP, and  the findings are disturbing. Here are some key discoveries:\n\nCorrupt deals: Since August 5, several coordinators have received large sums of money in exchange for withdrawing cases against pro-AL businessmen.\n\nRecruitment and recommendation business: Coordinators are earning hefty incomes by providing recommendations for recruitment and promotions. Nahid's father even opened an office in Dhaka that operated according to recommendation transaction rules until it was shut down by some pro-BNP YouTube uses.\n\nGovernment project bidding sales: Coordinators Nusrat Tabassum and Abu Hanan Masud awarded bids to a company without auction for the Khulna-Mongla new highway project.\n\nSuspicious donations: The Bashundhara Group donated 1.5 billion take to the coordinators, and there are rumors that the ISI is also funding them.\n\nThese allegations are shocking, and I'm concerned that student leaders may be using their positions for personal gain. As someone who cares about the future of Bangladesh, I urge everyone to keep a close eye on these development and demand that the relevant authorities investigate these allegations.\n\nWhat do you think about these allegations? Do you think student leaders are living up to their promises, or should we take a more critical look at their roles in key positions?",

        "title": "NCP wants to change CAS - Faham Abdus Salam's Post",
        "body": "General Walker being labeled as someone serving India's interests is a narrative introduced by a YouTuber. Stories like this are quite popular in Bangladesh, but they rarely achieve anything significant. This is a characteristic of the region's politics. I've observed rural folks recognizing simple patterns and arriving at astonishing conclusions. They can interpret the fall of the Roman Empire from a single grain of rice. You'll hear countless stories here. There was no end to tales about Indira Gandhi's father Nehru, Bhutto, or Iskander Mirza.\n\nInterestingly, those spreading these stories know that the claim about Walker being India's agent is false. At this moment, serving India's purpose in the country is impossible. Such connections among high officials no longer exist. (This isn't a James Bond movie where you instantly become the security chief or a minister's close friend of another country and end up in bed with them.) For anyone in Bangladesh attempting this, the risk involved cannot be compensated by India.\n\nI can say with 100% certainty that many important leaders don't even meet their Indian counterparts. They refuse requests for home visits. India is a highly toxic brand in Bangladesh, and politicians understand this better than anyone.\n\nSo why was this story introduced?\n\nFor one reason and one reason only.\n\nWalker is adamant about holding elections by December. From the beginning, he has supported early elections and democratic transitions. If Walker remains the chief and Yunus the chief advisor, elections will happen. However, if Walker is ousted and General Faiz becomes the chief, there is at least a chance to delay the elections—this is a narrative circulating in the market. It's completely absurd, but many desperate people are buying into it. The belief is that General Faiz is affiliated with Hizb ut-Tahrir and/or Jamaat. You'll find both versions in the field. I don't know whose man Faiz actually is or isn't, but Bangladesh's power players believe Faiz is associated with Jamaat or Hizb ut-Tahrir. Based on this, the idea is that if Walker is removed and Faiz becomes the chief, elections can be delayed—or at least an attempt can be made.\n\nIn this equation, Walker isn't the main issue. He's secondary. The main issue is stopping BNP. To stop BNP, elections need to be delayed, and NCP needs to be strengthened further. Large funds are required from Bashundhara and other businessmen. These need to be arranged. At least three government advisors are involved in activities to stop BNP. The biggest backer is Adilur Rahman Shubhra. He's almost openly involved. He has directly told many people about stopping BNP.\n\nTo my knowledge, at least two student leaders are also involved. However, I'm not personally sure if they know the full picture.\n\n…………….\n\nThe times are quite interesting!\n\nLook, private individuals or a political party can certainly try to stop BNP, but I have three general observations:\n\n1. Can advisors of a neutral government directly work to stop BNP while in power?\n2. Those who have entered the game of making BNP an enemy—I hope they won't blame BNP in the future for not maintaining unity.\n3. Politics is a brutal game. When BNP retaliates, it will be equally ugly.\n\n(My question:\n\nI'm asking you to consider a hypothetical scenario. You know that Yunus has already stated that elections will be held in December.\n\nIn a Zoom meeting, many are present. There are expatriate private citizens. An advisor is also present. In that meeting, a prominent speaker is directly talking about delaying elections and collecting funds from Bashundhara. Note that an advisor is personally involved in efforts to disrupt the chief advisor and the democratic process.\n\nDo you think this is a conspiracy? Or treason?\n\nWhat’s your opinion?)",

When they questioned him, he insulted them, and in response, one of them threw her tea at him. Rinku hit her, she hit back, and he started bleeding.\n\nTwo passersby tried to intervene but were also beaten. Rinku left and returned with 30-40 men, who surrounded the women, claiming they shouldn’t smoke in public. When one of them recorded, the men cornered them against a wall, grabbed their clothes, and tried to snatch the phone.\n\nWhen they ran, the mob chased, caught them, broke one woman’s glasses, and dragged them into a residential compound. About 7-8 men held them inside, deleting their recordings, while others guarded the gate. They were mocked, called drug addicts, and told if they were men, they \"wouldn’t be so lucky.\"\n\nThe fact is, the Jamaati Shibir uprising and growth is becoming a huge problem these days and something needs to be done about it. Or else, we might see the nation going back 10-20 years behind eventually because of all of this BS.\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "History of July Movement by Zulkarnain Saer",
        "body": "**Part 1/4**\n\n \n\nSeeing the slanging match between Students Against Discrimination (SAD) and Shibir over each party’s contribution to the July uprising and the toppling of the dictator, me and my comrades thought we should set the record straight. Since I live on another continent and had thousand other tasks to do during the movement, the responsibility of coordination on the field fell on the shoulders of my longtime confidante, who is a senior journalist with a leading newspaper in Bangladesh. Here’s how each piece of the jigsaw came together…\n\nOn the 26th of July at 10:10 pm, my confidante received a text from a contact asking her if she had a safe house to shelter four protest leaders, who were trying to lose detectives after escaping a hospital. They were stranded in an ambulance near the US embassy. She straightaway called me and that is how I became acutely involved with the students’ activities. I suggested she contact our US embassy contact to see what can be done. She reminds our contact, who is a top official of the US mission in Dhaka, that there is precedence of the US embassy providing shelter, as they did in the case of Imran Ahmed Bhuiyan, the deputy attorney general who was sacked in September 2023 for making a statement that went against the Awami League government’s narrative. Much to her dismay, she was told that would not be possible for several reasons, one of which was that the US mission was without an ambassador and the chargé d’affaires would not risk facing the wrath of the Hasina government. But she will make a few calls to her friends \\*in her personal capacity\\* to see if anyone is interested in helping.\n\nIn the meantime, my confidante reached out to her other contacts but in vain. If nothing could be managed, she was willing to host the boys at her place. But about 20 minutes later, the US embassy contact called her back with the good news that the boys could stay at the office of a foreign organisation in Gulshan and one of its top officials would be receiving them. After learning this, I called the WhatsApp number that was provided to my confidante by the contact to inform them of the development. The number was of a student named Salman, who, I found out with the rest of the world on the 23rd of September, was Shadik Kayem, the former president of Shibir's DU unit. I also contacted my sources in Dhaka to work out the best route for them to reach Gulshan-2 without coming into contact with any police or army. The boys — there were four of them — were put in two rickshaws and safely dropped off at the venue. By 11 pm, the boys were in safety. We were informed that the boys would have to leave the premises by 9 am on Sunday the 28th of July before the office staff clocked in for work.\n\nThe next day, which was the 27th of July, Shahidul Alam bhai heard about the boys and took them into his care in the evening. For the next two days, we were under the impression that the boys were safe with him. Meanwhile, Salman called me asking if I could help them book the EMK Centre for a few hours in the next 2-3 days to hold an exhibition on the movement. I asked my confidante to speak to Salman to figure out what they were actually trying to do. She heard Salman’s plan and contacted Shafiqul Alam, who was the bureau chief of AFP then, and the most respected rights activist Rezaur Rahman Lenin to see if they could help with the booking. EMK Centre would not be possible as all bookings needed security clearance and Drik Gallery would not be open to such an event until the 10th of August. Both discouraged the idea of the exhibition, which was conveyed to Salman. The idea was binned right then and there.\n\nAt 12:09 pm on the 28th of July, my confidante gets a message from Salman asking for a safe house for Abdul Kader. She passed on the message to me and I then reached out to a contact who works for an embassy. He agrees to host Kader at his home in Gulshan, which is a stone’s throw from the US embassy. He also offered to pick Kader up but it had to be done after his office ended at 4 pm. I then asked my confidante to coordinate things. Kader was at Shonir Akhra and it wouldn’t have been possible to go all the way there and return to Gulshan before the curfew started at 6 pm, so Kader was asked to come midway. With this, Tarique Rahman was looped into this student cohort's developments; he was closely monitoring the events through Mir Helal, the assistant organising secretary of BNP in Chittagong, who was in constant touch with Kader’s host.\n\nAt night we learn that the six SAD coordinators — Nahid Islam, Asif Mahmud, Sarjis Alam, Hasnat Abdullah, Abu Baker Mojumder and Nusrat Tabassum — have called off the movement from the DB office. We were gobsmacked. At 9:50 pm Salman informed my confidante that the movement would continue, with Kader, Hannan, Rifat and Mahin taking things forward. I suggested the four new leaders record a video message from where they are and I asked my confidante to coordinate things on the ground. Salman sent over the message that the new batch of SAD leaders would be reading out announcing the continuation of the movement and asked my confidante to quickly edit it. She asked me to edit it, while she translated the message into English. Both messages were sent to Salman by 11:04 pm but we could not find the communiqué anywhere. At 11:35 pm, Salman informed my confidante that their think-tank was debating whether the one-point demand, i.e. Hasina’s resignation, would be announced now instead of the nine-point demand of the students. In the end, the students decided to stick to the nine-point demand for now. The final version of the communiqué was put on the SAD letterhead and circulated everywhere at midnight. Kader recorded the video message in both English and Bangla from a teleprompter downloaded from the Internet by his host. I shared the video message on my social media channels. The other three also posted their video messages.\n\nThe next day, which is the 29th of July, at 4:50 pm, my confidante gets a call from Salman asking if a safe house could be arranged for Hannan, Rifat, Mahin and Mehedi, who later turned out to be Abdul Gaffar Jisun of Chhatra Dol's Jahangirnagar unit. They were sat in a North End Coffee Roasters branch in Gulshan and needed to move to a safe zone ASAP as the curfew would start in an hour. My confidante frenetically called her friends and work contacts to see if anyone would be brave enough to host the boys for a couple of hours until she arranged a place for them to spend the night. At one point, she even considered sending the boys to her office, which remained outside the purview of law enforcement agencies. However, she didn’t have to resort to this step as our friends Fahim Ahmed and Andaleeb Chowdhury agreed to host the boys at their home in Banani. By then, North End had closed for the day and the boys took shelter at a coaching centre in Banani. She then coordinated things with Andaleeb, who went to pick up the boys from their hiding spot. Andaleeb is a lecturer at a private university and she was closely involved with the quota movement from the 18th of July, when the private university students joined in. The boys immediately feel safe around her and she informs my confidante that they could stay the night. Andaleeb’s husband Fahim is the CEO of a prominent company and my confidante was adamant that she would not be jeopardising our friend’s career and the company’s future by involving them any further in this movement. Despite their protests, she told the couple that the boys would be moved the next morning. So off she starts with her phone calls to find a safe house for the boys. She asked Kader’s host if he could accommodate four more boys in his flat but he didn’t have room. However, he agreed to help her find a shelter. At 7:29 pm, he informs my confidante that he has found a safe house in Old Dhaka. However, transporting the boys from Banani to Old Dhaka would be quite the challenge amid the heightened security situation, so she reached out to Reza to do the deed. And he agreed. In the meantime, I arranged a backup safe house for them in Mirpur DOHS. Owahid Alam, who I know through BNP people, agreed to play host, and I passed on his contact details to my confidante in case she needed his help.\n\n\n\n**Part 2/4**\n\n\n\nOn the morning of 30th July, Reza arrives at Fahim and Andaleeb’s home in Banani to move the boys to the next safe house in Old Dhaka. Once there, Reza felt the location, which was a stone’s throw from the court, was not secure enough. The boys were not happy with the condition of the living quarters and threw a hissy fit. They wanted to go back to Fahim and Andaleeb’s, which my confidante was dead against. Still, the boys called Andaleeb and she even asked them to come back. But my confidante was firm on this. She asked Owahid Alam if his offer of a safe house was still valid and he was beyond gracious. His details were passed on to Reza, who then dropped the boys off at the safe house, which happens to be the headquarters of Owahid Alam's buying house. The flat was very secure and the amenities met the boys’ standards, which the spot in Old Dhaka didn’t. Reza also downloaded premium versions of VPN on the boys' phones using my confidante’s international credit card.\n\nWhile my confidante was coordinating things with Reza, she also received a text from Salman at 2:13 pm asking for ideas on what programme they could announce for the following day. At 3:24 pm, Salman asks her opinion on staging nationwide protests outside courts. She loves the idea and also suggests staging protests on the periphery of campuses, which were blocked off then. At 4:54 pm, Salman asked my confidante to talk to Hannan and get him to announce this programme from their Facebook pages as Hannan was considering distributing leaflets as the following day’s programme. She talks to Hannan and he agrees. At 5:32 pm, Salman sends the Bangla communiqué to my confidante for vetting and asks her to translate it into English. By evening the programme was announced. In the meantime, Hannan asked my confidante if she could arrange fresh clothes and lungis for them and sent their measurements. She then hands over money to her coworker who lives in Mirpur and asks him to buy clothes and drop them off at Mirpur DOHS. Since the curfew had already started by then, all stores had shut for the day. Her coworker then asks one of his friends who knows a clothing store proprietor to sneakily reopen his store. The clothes were picked up by Owahid Alam from a designated spot in Mirpur the following morning.\n\nAt 1:31 pm on the 31st of July, Salman texts my confidante to inform the incredible response to that day’s programme. This text was followed up by a suggestion of announcing a “soft” programme for the following day, such as distributing leaflets. She strictly told Salman not to entertain the idea as it is an environmentally unfriendly move and being Gen-Z they should be more conscious of such things. She also discouraged announcing a soft programme for the following day as it would slow down the momentum of the movement. She instead suggests demonstrating outside the UN office the following day demanding an independent investigation by the organisation into the massacre. Salman then gets back to her saying that the others want a soft programme for the following day and that the demonstration outside the UN building could be done the day after. The day after was the weekend, so it would be pointless. If they had to demonstrate outside the UN building, it had to be done on the following day, which was a Thursday. Salman said he would bounce it with the others and get back to her. He also asked if she could arrange a safe house for two more SAD leaders and she agreed.\n\nMeanwhile, she gets a call from Kader’s host informing her that Nahid’s guru has advised him to slow down the movement and pivot it to one for reopening the university halls. Who was Nahid’s guru? Some guy named Mahfuj Abdullah, who now goes by the name Mahfuj Alam. She then calls up Shafiqul Alam to enquire about Mahfuj Abdullah. Turns out Shafiqul Alam knew this Mahfuj Abdullah very well; he had managed jobs for Mahfuj at two Bangla dailies, where he couldn't last for long. She asks him to have a word with Mahfuj so that he keeps quiet and doesn’t divert the movement. Shafiqul Alam calls her back three hours later to let her know that Mahfuj has been warned not to be a roadblock to this movement. She also asks Salman about this Mahfuj and strictly tells him not to slow down the movement. Salman informs her that there are many stakeholders in this movement and reaching a consensus among all parties has been a pain. And yet, for as long as he is alive, the movement will continue with gusto — he is willing to give his life for the cause and has been working like a dog. He then tells her that he wrote the students’ nine-point demand and went to media houses in person to relay it during the Internet blackout. But, the following day’s programme has to be a soft one as the boys are rather tired and need a little breather. He asks her for a catchy title and hashtag for the programme. She asks Fahim if he could help with this and he sends her a bunch of hashtags and titles. Since the students were set on a soft programme for that day, she suggested a countrywide candlelight vigil for the dead at 9 pm as that would make for powerful, moving imagery. Salman also loves the idea and says he will discuss it with others. And yet at 8:56 pm, Salman says the following day’s programme would be called Remembering the Heroes and it would entail a host of cultural activities — and no candlelight vigil. And for Saturday they were planning a March for Campus programme to get the authorities to reopen schools, colleges and universities. She talks to Kader’s host, who is equally livid. My confidante then scolds Salman for taking the momentum off the movement with this programme. If they continue to focus on their campus-centric demand, their movement will go nowhere. The public support will also tail off as it is not possible to live in this heightened sense of intensity for long. Sheikh Hasina will regroup and will hunt each and every one of them down. And that she was not endangering her friends’ lives and careers just so they could get their quota. At 11:15 pm, Salman asks her if she could sit down with all the student leaders in a Zoom meeting and tell them these things. She agrees but the meeting never happens.\n\n\n\n**Part 3/4**\n\n \n\nOn the 1st of August, at 11:36 am, Salman texted my confidante with photos of the demonstration they were staging at the campus. He also asks her to shortlist the hashtags from Fahim for sharing in their student groups. At 4:23 pm, my confidante again scolds Salman via text seeing the public reaction to the Remembering the Heroes programme. She also tells him that the bloodshed will continue for as long as they press for their self-centred nine-point demand. And it’s absurd that they were demanding justice from the murderer. “It is very easy for her to play you guys,” she texted Salman. At 4:45 pm, Salman called back my confidante and pleaded with her not to abandon them at this point and that he would be following her directions here onwards.\n\nAround 5 pm Hannan calls my confidante asking her to arrange transport and another safe house for them. Why so? Because the entire state machinery was looking for him — and not Riffat, Mahin or Kader — and he didn’t feel safe in the Mirpur DOHS flat. She asks him if he has disclosed his location to anyone and he says he hasn’t. In that case, she told him that he couldn’t have been in a safer place anywhere in Bangladesh. Within minutes of her phone call with Hannan, she gets another call from Reza. Hannan also called him making the same request. Turns out they are panicking because they have lost the house key and could not reach Owahid Alam on the phone. Reza again called to inform that the situation had been neutralised: the keys were in their bedside drawer and Owahid Alam, who went out of Dhaka that day, could be reached on the phone. It must be mentioned that Owahid Alam was the most responsible and gracious host: he bought the boys two weeks’ groceries, told them they could help themselves to the brand new clothes lying at his buying house office and instructed the cleaner not to come so that the boys' safety was not compromised.\n\nThe six coordinators were released that evening from DB custody and Hasnat and Sarjis put up ambiguous FB posts, which irritated my confidante. She discusses the matter with her coworker who helped in sourcing clothes for Hannan &amp; co. and he argues with her that this is not the time to demand Hasina's resignation. She then discusses the issue with Shafiqul Alam, who tells her that she should pipe down now as the students' leaders are out and they will take a call on this. He maintains that Hasina will fall sooner or later — there is no coming back from this. She discusses this with Fahim, who seemed equally frustrated that the call for Hasina’s resignation has not come yet. Kader’s host agreed that the one-point demand must be made soon.\n\nThen at 10:24 pm, Salman sent my confidante a photo of a candlelight vigil outside the East West University in Rampura. After that, he sends her a news link of police cracking down on a candlelight vigil in Narayanganj. He then continues to send photos of candlelight vigils taking place all over the country.\n\nAt 12:50 pm on the 2nd of August, my confidante sends Salman the following text: “Without asking for her resignation, you guys are on a suicide mission.” Salman immediately replies that they are on nine-point demand now but a meeting is scheduled later in the day where the matter of one-point demand will be discussed. She again tells Salman that the one-point demand must be fast-tracked as Hasina apologists have started a global campaign that Bangladesh has no alternative to her. Salman again replies that he is trying to do that but there are lots of internal problems, which he is trying to solve first — and that Sarjis, Hasnat are “dalals”. Those two are on the last warning and if they overstep they would be asked to leave the platform. At 2:08 pm, Salman shares the link to a video posted by Hannan that asks Hasina to accept the students’ nine-point demand to which my confidante says: “This was a very selfish video.” She further writes: \"Say Hasina accepts your nine-point demand, but what about all those non-student lives that have been lost? Do you guys not want justice for their deaths? So many children and professionals lost their lives and so many people have become permanently disabled.\" Salman assures her that he will press all these points in their meeting later in the day. He then shares another video posted by Mahin that focuses on the same points as Hannan. At 2:36 pm, Salman informs my confidante that Sarjis and Hasnat have called off SAD’s programme for the day and asks her to talk to Kader and Hannan about the one-point demand. He will also connect my confidante with Asif Mahmud, who was also looking for a safe house. My confidante tells Salman that she would arrange a safe house for Asif only if they make the one-point demand. They just needed to make the official call for Hasina’s resignation and the public would take it forward. She discusses providing the safe house with Kader's host, who points out that since Asif was released from DB custody the previous day he is being tailed off by plainclothes policemen. Putting him in a safe house now would blow the cover of everyone involved, so he advised her to convey to Asif that he was safe where he was.\n\nMeanwhile, my confidante gets the following text from Fahim: Today was the important 2-week/15-day mark. Things start to set in place after two weeks (one way or another). So today is the day. What reason did they give for not making the call for Hasina to step down? Today was Jummah + the Jamaat-Shibir ban.” She shared this with me and I suggest she meet with Kader’s host and Owahid Alam to discuss the way forward.\n\nAt 4 pm, she arrives at Kader’s host’s apartment and the three call me. Owahid Alam was hesitant, whereas the other two were adamant that the demand for Hasina's resignation must come now. I then offered to get on-the-ground information from my sources to work out if that day was opportune for such a monumental announcement. At 5 pm, I connected them with an intelligence source who said the call must come today after Maghrib prayers for maximum impact. We do not have long as Hasina’s forces are regrouping to quash the movement. Within minutes, my confidante gets a call from Shafiqul Alam telling her it’s time to make the call for Hasina’s resignation seeing the bloodshed in Khulna and Uttara earlier in the day; he also shared links of the call already being made by Anu Mohammad and the artists earlier in the day. Her coworker who was against the one-point demand just the previous day also called to tell her that it was time. Fahim also texts her that it is time to make the call. She, Kader’s host and Owahid Alam decide to get Kader, Hannan, Mahin and Rifat to make the one-point demand. Technically, the four of them were still SAD’s leaders as the six coordinators who were released from the DB custody the previous day have not officially rejoined the movement. They discussed this with Kader, who agreed to do this provided Salman, Hannan, Rifat and Mahin were on board too. They call Salman, who says he’s ready to provide backing on the field once the call is made. My confidante asked her coworker to write the message that Kader, Hannan, Rifat and Mahin would be reading out. Within 15 minutes he sent a draft that was shared with me, Fahim and Shafiqul Alam for feedback. A few minor edits were made by me, Fahim and Owahid Alam and the draft was good to go. By then, the call for Maghrib prayers was blasting on the speakers and Owahid Alam headed out for the prayers and was off-grid for a good 30 minutes or so and our plan was delayed.\n\nKader also informs Rifat, Hannan and Mahin of the plan and the three seem shaky. Seeing their jitteriness, Kader also dithers and asks to speak with BNP and Jamaat leadership to get assurance from them that the two would be supporting SAD’s call for Hasina’s resignation. My three comrades assure the boys that once they make the call, the general public will take the movement forward. Their call would just be a formality, like passing the baton on to the general public. The people are already fed up with her and they just want to drive her away. Besides, many other associations have already made the call. Since the movement started with them, they should nicely wrap it up with the announcement. This seemed to have reassured them and they were ready to roll. Ten minutes later, Hannan calls my confidante with a fresh demand from their side, and with it, starts a series of bargaining that goes on for the entire evening. At one point, they demand that their families be moved to an embassy before they make the one-point demand. Kader’s host explained to them that it was not possible at that moment, but it could be a possibility once they demand Hasina’s resignation as the foreign missions would then be concerned about their safety. This seems to have convinced the trio. But they call back again after ten minutes raising objections to the communiqué prepared for them. Their issue was that it did not give a roadmap for how the state would function after Hasina’s resignation. My confidante explains that it is not their concern as they are still students or fresh graduates. They neither have the life experience nor the educational qualifications to dictate the course for 170 million people, they should let the adults take control of things. Again, this seemed to have convinced the trio of Hannan, Rifat and Mahin. But they call back again after ten minutes. At this point, my confidante lost her patience and checked out. The others called me and asked to add a line that the post-Hasina Bangladesh would be run by representatives of political parties, university teachers, civil society, armed forces and students. I agreed to add this line to the communiqué. But they again call. They want the students to be mentioned first and before the other stakeholders. It was then that I also lost my patience as it was past 11 pm and there was no point making the announcement at that hour of the day. I must definitively state that the boys were not coerced in any way to make the one-point demand and yet Hannan went around telling people that I threatened him, Rifat and Mahin on behalf of the army, who were too eager to take control of the state. There was no such intent — all we wanted was to get rid of Hasina and her mafia gang. We had no other agenda, which is why none of us have come forward post-5th of August to get our stake in the government by overselling our contributions. All of us remain where we were before SAD's quota movement began — with no material improvement in our lives other than the peace and satisfaction that Hasina and her goons were gone. If anything, it was Salman with whom my confidante spoke very harshly many times, but not with the four SAD leaders.\n\n\n\n**PART 4/4**\n\n\n\nFunnily enough, SAD calls for a programme at Shaheed Minar the next day, i.e. the 3rd of August, at 3 pm. At 1:05 pm, Hannan called my confidante asking her permission to move to another safe house arranged by Nahid for them. Over at Shaheed Minar at 3 pm, Nahid made the call for Hasina’s resignation. By then, it didn’t matter, the streets of Dhaka and elsewhere were alive with slogans calling for Hasina to step down. We learn from Kader afterwards that Nahid, Mahfuj, Asif and the rest of the SAD coordinators had no intention of going for the one-point demand anytime soon. They were compelled to do so because of our desperation the previous day. Nahid wanted the limelight on himself -- he didn’t want Kader, Hannan, Rifat and Mahin to have that recognition of calling for Hasina’s resignation. Kader particularly found it amusing that Hannan blocked Kader, Riffat and Mahin from making the call the previous evening as he did not want to do it without his “Nahid bhai” but his Nahid bhai made the call that day at Shaheed Minar without Hannan next to him. SAD also called for a non-cooperation movement the following day, a move that did not sit nicely with the foreign missions, as my confidante learnt from her contacts.\n\nAt 7:56 pm, Salman shares a list of demands from SAD with my confidante seeking her input. She advises Salman that it would be best if SAD blends in with the general public and does not make any separate demands other than Hasina’s resignation. If they make separate demands now, they would come across as self-serving and power-hungry and people will start to doubt their intentions. Their lives have just started, they have their entire lives ahead of them to come to power. They should just get back to their normal lives after Hasina is gone and get life experience before considering running for office. Salman agrees with her and says they would not be making any separate demands and would just be sticking to the one point. Salman then asks her what should be their next move and she suggests surrounding Gonobhaban and all ministers’ residences. She also explains to him how the Hasina/Awami League still enjoyed international support as none from the West asked for her resignation yet or an independent investigation; all of them said that all deaths must be investigated and she should enter into a dialogue with the protestors. It’s like they are asking the murderer to investigate the murder. Salman asks her what can be done now to change the international community’s mind and she tells him to just focus on getting Hasina out. At 9:21 pm, Salman informs her of their plan to gather at 12 spots in the city from 10 am and march towards Gonobhaban from there. Meanwhile, I heard from my sources that the Awami League had planned to unleash about 15,000 of their men in Dhaka on the 4th of August. This was conveyed to Salman via my confidante.\n\nOn the 4th of August, the plan to surround Gonobhaban failed to take off as armed Awami League men were plying the streets and causing a bloodbath. By mid-day, Asif and Nahid had announced SAD’s programmes for the next two days and that infuriated my confidante. While sat at Comptoirs Richards in Gulshan, my confidante called Owahid Alam at 2:16 pm to express her frustration that SAD intends to continue this way for the next few days and they do not have a plan to surround the Gonobhaban anytime soon. She asked Owahid Alam to convey the message to the opposition political parties to take charge of the situation and not leave it to SAD. He assures her that something will be done; Hasina’s days as the prime minister are numbered. At 3:20 pm, she calls Salman expressing her frustration with Asif’s announcement and tells her that she’s checking out of this movement. Salman pleads with her not to quit at this stage and that he will see what can be done. At 3:25 pm, I sent my confidante a message from my intel source that Awami League was \"regrouping, SAD must bring forward their March to Dhaka programme by a day, no more time can be wasted, people want that programme tomorrow\". She forwarded this message to both Reza and Owahid Alam. Reza immediately calls and tells her to calm down. She tells him that she’s out of this movement. He asks her what she wants and she has one demand: a Gonobhaban sit-in starting tomorrow until she resigns. He asks her to calm down as there are lots of factors that must align for this drastic step to take place. At 3:52 pm, Reza texts her saying: “Done. Happy?” How did he manage it? Via an intermediary, he got BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir to talk to Nahid. At 5:21 pm, Asif announced on his Facebook page that the March to Dhaka programme had been brought forward by a day to the 5th of August.\n\nAll SAD coordinators then started posting their video message announcing the March to Dhaka programme but we wanted Kader’s one to be a cut above the rest. We wanted him to sound calm, composed, honourable and just. My confidante once again asked her coworker to write the draft of Kader’s message in Bangla, which she translated into English. I shared Kader’s English and Bengla video messages on my social media channels. At 11:11 pm, I got on a group call with my confidante, Fahim and Salman to work out the logistics for the Gonobhaban sit-in programme the next day. Reza and Owahid Alam went to the flat of Kader’s host for further planning.\n\nOn the morning of 5th August, my confidante was shaken to hear from Fahim that police had gotten inside Bashundhara and were firing inside university campuses. She starts receiving texts from others that the situation is looking grim everywhere else. At 11:32 am, she gets a text from Owahid Alam that says that Hasina won’t be allowed to stay in power beyond today. \"We are ready for the final showdown,\" he wrote. At 1:35 pm, Salman calls my confidante to find out if there are any updates and she tells him to get everyone out. At 1:59 pm, he again texts her saying they were all headed towards Gonobhaban. At 2:30 pm, my confidante gets a text from Shafiqul Alam informing that Hasina and Rehana have fled Gonobhaban. Soon after, Salman calls her with tears of joy gushing out of his voice. He again calls her in the early hours of 6th August to let her know that Muhammad Yunus has agreed to helm the interim government — he just got off a call with the Nobel Laureate.\n\n",

        "body": "According to my BGS teacher, in 2005, there lived a boy named Adnan in Banasree, Rampura. He was in class 9 or 10, and commitment a violent crime. Our teacher didn't give the full information, so here's what I know.\n\n\nAdnan's parents were divorced, and he mostly stayed home alone as his father worked. He befriended with some guys and went to, perhaps Hatirjheel. There they wanted to take a lift from a car, model unknown, and then shot the driver with a pistol. They threw his almost dead body in a canal perhaps, I'm not familiar with the place, and took the car on there own hands. They drove around the whole city.\nThe next day, police rescued the driver. After that, they started investigating about the car. They contacted the car owner, as the driver was not in a position to talk. \nOn the other hand, those kids parked the car in Adnan's garage. \nAfter 2 or 3 months, people got suspicious about the car and contacted the police. Police came and confirmed the car. They interrogated Adnan and found out athe thing. \n\nAdnan lived at block C, road 6. Our teacher never mentioned which house, his full name or anything. We know that his or his friend's father was in Mohanogor something. He was in Ideal School and College, Banasree branch. According to our teacher, that news was broadcasted all over the nation.\n\n\nWill anyone help to know more about the incident? Or, where is Adnan now? I'm not sure if our teacher made up that. But if not, then please help us know more about it.\nThanks.",

        "title": "After 5th August ",
        "body": "A lot of people don't realise the good stuffs that has happened since 5th August, and no, I am not saying this ironically. We all are well aware of the messed up bits in last 120 days or so. Now, let me put the things that went right (and probably how things may go from here). This won't be a top 10 Yusuf sorkar achievements...I'll write mostly from my POV. \n\n\nAfter 5th August, the police was virtually non existent. They were supposed to join within 15th August, but, many of them would not until the end of the month (and some even after that). Imagine for a sec, even in a first world country like the USA, what ruckus would happen had something even remotely similar to this had happened? \n\n\nIn out context, a few robbery attempts here and there (95-99% of which were unsuccessful), and the BAL goons (politically posted or otherwise), got a little payback of their karma. That's all. Our friends across the border speak of minority this and that, and yet, almost all the hindu named individuals that suffered any form of oppression/attack was due to their affiliation with BAL, and not due to their faith. I feel the propaganda peddlers (both in and out) know this very well, and yet try to hide it because a \"BANGLADESH HAS TURNED TALIBAN!\" newsflash sells better. \n\n\n\nOr even let's say this year's Durga Puja..I still remember the horrors that happened in 2021 during DP when BAL government was in power, houses after houses being burnt indiscriminately by local politically sheltered goons and BAL affiliates, and I felt so humiliated to even talk to a lot of my hindu friends..knowing we have failed them as a nation. And no, there was no Prabhu Chinmoy Das back then coming up with his revolutionary 8 points and blocking cities here and there...even the responses of Hindu Mohajot, Bangladesh Hindu-Buddhist-Christian alliance sounded as if it were written by someone from the failed administration.  \n\n \nYet, this year, all you hear (there could be more, that's as much as I'm aware of), is some deranged drunkard/grifter/paid political minion hacking a few individuals in Puran Dhaka  and that's it. A few of my hindu friends said they never felt more safer (things can be different outside Dhaka though, but the overall security did indeed seem to be a lot better than the past). With India and BAL continuously trying to malign, undermine, and spread disinformation/misinformation about this government, how is that not a freaking achievement? \n\n\nBAL had an 1984esque iron grip over each and every single thing that went in and out of this country for last 16 years, and no power transition from a fascist regime is ever smooth. From ansars to titumir leagues, think for a minute how often have they tried to create a chaos and somehow benefit from it..and yet, at the end, we are pretty united as a nation. \n\n\nHowever, the path ahead will be difficult. BNP (or a significant portion of it) seems to be trying their best to outcompete BAL in terms of making up for what they were unable to do in last 16 years..and they will try their best to force (if you know, you know what that means) the interim government to hold elections asap, and there is no reason the existing BAL elites (political and business) will not try to benefit out of it. With different hujur groups increasing everyday in strengths and numbers, it would be interesting to see how powerful they eventually end up politics-wise. But whoever ends up doing whatever, one thing is for certain..that 2025 will be pretty chaotic.\n\n\n\n\n ",

        "body": "Child Musa, who was shot during the mass uprising, is showing signs of improvement. Currently receiving treatment at a Singapore hospital, Musa has now opened his eyes and started moving his limbs. Shahriar Mahmud Yamin, member of the central sub-committee on health of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, shared this information on Saturday.\n\nMusa's mother Nishamoni stated, \"My son no longer needs life support. He can move his arms and legs a little on his own. He is opening his eyes and looking. Before he wouldn't blink, but now he does.\" Shahriar Mahmud Yamin informed that the government has initially sent 1.75 crore taka for Musa's treatment excluding other associated costs, and preparations are underway to send another 1 crore taka in the second phase.\n\nNotably, Musa was shot on July 19 while going to buy ice cream with his grandmother in the Meradia Hat area of Rampura, Dhaka. After receiving treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Combined Military Hospital, he was sent to Singapore on October 22.",

This message, detailing the attacks on the EPR and police barracks in Dhaka, was sent to Chittagong, where AL leader M.A. Hannan and Major Ziaur Rahman of the East Bengal Regiment broadcast it on the radio on behalf of Mujib. News of this declaration quickly spread worldwide through international newspapers. As per the sixth schedule of the Constitution of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu’s telegram read:\n\n“This may be my last message; from today, Bangladesh is independent. I call upon the people of Bangladesh, wherever you may be and with whatever you have, to resist the occupation army to the last. Your fight must continue until the last soldier of the Pakistani occupation army is expelled from the soil of Bangladesh, and final victory is achieved.” \\[1\\]\n\nMujib’s telegram was widely aired on March 26, 1971. AL secretary M.A. Hannan read the statement in Bengali at 2:30 p.m. and again at 7:40 p.m. from a Chittagong radio station, proclaiming:\n\n*“Today, Bangladesh is a sovereign and independent country. On Thursday night, March 25, 1971, the West Pakistani armed forces suddenly attacked the police barracks at Razarbagh and the EPR headquarters at Pilkhana in Dhaka. Many innocent and unarmed people have been killed in Dhaka and other areas of Bangladesh. Violent clashes between EPR and police on one side and the Pakistani Armed Forces on the other are ongoing. The Bengalis are courageously fighting the enemy for an independent Bangladesh. May Allah aid us in our fight for freedom. Joy Bangla.”* \\[2\\]\n\nMeanwhile before that, following failed peace talks, Yahya Khan imposed martial law and ordered the military crackdown on Bengali political activities. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested before midnight on March 26, 1971, and flown to West Pakistan from Tejgaon International Airport. Major Ziaur Rahman, initially the Bangladesh Forces Commander of Sector 1 and later Sector 11 from June, and Brigade Commander of Z Force from mid-July, was asked by local Awami League supporters and leaders to announce the Declaration of Independence previously made by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nZia’s initial proclamation stated: *“I, Major Ziaur Rahman, Provincial Head of the government, do hereby declare the Independence of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.”* This announcement, however, faced criticism for naming Zia as the “Provincial Head,” a mistake he quickly realized.\n\nLater that day, on March 27, a corrected statement was broadcast: *“I, Major Zia, on behalf of our Great Leader, the Supreme Commander of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, do hereby proclaim the independence of Bangladesh.”* \\[3\\]\n\nFinally, on April 10, 1971, the Provisional Government of Bangladesh issued the Proclamation of Independence, affirming Mujib’s original declaration. This proclamation also officially recognized the title \"Bangabandhu,\" stating:\n\n*“Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the undisputed leader of the 75 million people of Bangladesh, in rightful fulfillment of the legitimate right to self-determination, formally declared the independence of Bangladesh on March 26, 1971, in Dhaka, urging the people of Bangladesh to defend the honor and integrity of their country.”* \\[4\\]\n\nThere’s recent news about making Ziaur Rahman the \"sole proclaimer\" of Bangladesh's independence in textbooks and plans to rewrite the curriculum. History here has often been rewritten by those in power, especially political parties, to fit their needs.\n\nWhen the BNP was in power, they tried to downplay Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s legacy, as he was the central figure of their rival, the Awami League. But his contributions couldn’t be erased. Similarly, the Awami League, when in power, sidelined figures like A.K. Fazlul Huq, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, and Maulana Bhashani, casting Ziaur Rahman in a negative light, given his central role in the BNP.\n\nMany Bangladeshis, myself included, are frustrated by this political toxicity. How long will this go on? Can we ever honour all our national heroes, proud of each one’s role in history, and unite as we did in 1971 for freedom and independence?\n\nSources:\n\n\\[1\\] [\"First Schedule\"](http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/upload/act/2022-04-18-13-27-54-Scheudle__367.pdf) (PDF). *Laws of Bangladesh*.\n\n\\[2\\] [\"Ziaur Rahman (Shaheed General Zia) - Declaration of Independence, 1975 coup - biography of Muslim and Bengali\"](http://www.londoni.co/index.php/69-history-of-bangladesh/biography/ziaur-rahman-shaheed-general-zia/394-ziaur-rahman-shaheed-general-zia-declaration-of-independence-1975-coup-biography-of-muslim-and-bengali)\n\n\\[3\\] [\"Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendro and Bangladesh's Declaration of Independence\"](http://www.thedailystar.net/swadhin-bangla-betar-kendro-and-bangladeshs-declaration-of-independence-52001). *The Daily Star*.

Even though their parents spent the money, they never learnt reading from school.\n\nWhy do I say this?\n\n&gt;Md Baker, 52, filed the case with Khilgaon Police Station accusing 180 persons including Panna on charge of shooting his son Ahadul Islam on July 19.\n\nNow, will people actively come out and say it wasn't the government? Of course not! They'll bitch and whine on it posts and threads and complain about how \"FREEDOM OF SPEECH DHONGNSHO HOIYE GIYECHE AMADER DESH ER MODDHE\" while not reading any articles on it.

        "body": "So it’s been two months since the revolution broke out in Bangladesh. We all saw how things escalated quickly, but there’s one part that no one seems to be talking about enough—the sniper deaths.\n\nThese weren’t random shootings. **Mareo Voroliev**, a former sniper expert from Russia’s Alpha Group, said: \"A regular shooter never takes a headshot at close range. Headshots are meant to ensure death and are done by mercenaries, sleeper contractors, or undercover operatives.” Sounds familiar, right? That’s exactly what’s happening here. From what I’ve seen and heard, people are talking about how these deaths don’t seem normal.\n\nHere’s what people have been saying:\n\n* Jatrabari, Badda, Uttara, Rampura—these areas saw strange deaths, even during the night.\n* People were shot with supersonic bullets with suppressors, which means there was barely any sound. Not your regular gunshots. This pattern is eerily similar to the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, where NATO contractors were involved.\n* People were shot from behind the neck, through the back, or even through the chest. These aren’t ordinary killings. Even Chief Prosecutor Tajul Islam pointed out that some of the attackers might be Hindi-speaking people. This needs to be investigated further.\n\nWitnesses and sources states that there’s something more going on. It’s not just random violence. There are people pulling the strings who are hiding in plain sight, just like what happened in Ukraine’s Maiden Square. If we can uncover the sniping operations, we might reveal who’s really behind all the bloodshed.\n\n**So what do you think? Have you seen anything similar, or do you think these are just baseless rumors? Should there be a deeper investigation into these deaths, or are people just exaggerating things to get more attention?**",

        "body": "The Mass Movement of '24 is very unique from other revolutions in that it's genuinely a universal Peoples' Movement. It wasn't spearheaded by a few vanguard parties, but rather pretty much **everyone** in Bangladeshi society contributed to the movement one way or another. Students from public and private unis, schools, colleges, madrassas, etc etc as well as the working class, minorities, civil servants **all** united to put down Hasina's brutal dictatorship once and for all. Heck, even the Army subtly switched sides near the end of the revolution.\n\nDespite this, I've recently noticed a social media push by Islamists claiming that the protestors were exclusively made up of Shibir and Madrassa students **(note: they're both completely different demographics, don't lump them together)**, whereas \"secular liberals\" were either BAL supporters or cowardly keyboard warriors who contributed nothing to the movement. This is clearly an attempt to turn this whole thing into a culture war by portraying it as a conflict between \"BAL seculars and liberals VS God-fearing Islamists\" **(ironically mirroring BAL propaganda)**\n\nYes, Madrassa students absolutely **did** contribute a ton to the revolutionary cause, the hellscape that was Jatrabari is a testiment to that. But to not only gatekeep the entire movement as if it's their own ancestral property, but also shamelessly and disgustingly whitewash the very real sacrifices made by people of other beliefs and ideologies, all this insidious crap by Islamists is just beyond me.\n\n",

There have been posts debunking these claims from both domestic and international sources. But the opposite is also true that there have been genuine attacks on minorities throughout Bangladesh in the previous days. During times of political instability, and change, minorities are the most vulnerable, so these attacks shouldn't come as a surprise.\n\nRecently, and by recently I mean very recently there was a post in this subreddit about the [Shahbag protests which were organized by Hindus](https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/hindus-stage-demo-shahbagh-protesting-attacks-minorities-913031) in response to the violence they faced in previous days. \n\nThe OP mentioned a photo of a child used by protestors who, in reality, did not die in the violence but during the quota protests, killed by bullets from police. Yeah, the use of that picture was wrong - there was nothing communal with her death. But the entire comment section dismissed the largest protest yet in the country by Hindus against the violence as \"BAL-sponsored.\" If that's the logic, then by that reasoning, this revolution was also entirely Jamat-BNP funded, just as Awami claimed. You’ll find some bad apples, just like in the quota protests, but nitpicking them to undermine an entire protest - especially when the vulnerable are speaking out with legitimate claims - makes you worse than anything.",

        "title": "The Last Hours of Dictator Hasina: A Tale of Desperation",
        "body": "Even at the last moment, killer Hasina wanted to stay in power through force.\n\nMultiple sources provided an account of Sheikh Hasina's last four hours in power. According to the latest information, she reached Delhi via Agartala in India's Tripura state. From there, she is likely to go to the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter deploying armed party workers and causing widespread conflict and casualties across the country last Sunday, Sheikh Hasina still couldn't control the student-public movement. Although she realized the situation, several leaders, including one of her advisors, tried to convince her on Sunday night. They suggested handing over power to the military. However, she refused and instead ordered a stricter curfew starting Monday. Although efforts to enforce the curfew began at dawn, protesters started breaking the curfew after 9 AM and gathered in various places by 10 AM.\n\nHigh-level sources from various forces said that around 10:30 AM, the heads of the three forces and the Inspector General of Police (IGP) were summoned to the Prime Minister's residence, Ganabhaban. She expressed anger about why the security forces couldn't control the situation. She was upset that protesters were climbing on armored vehicles and military trucks and painting them red, yet the forces were not taking harsh measures. She also mentioned that she trusted these officials with top positions.\n\nAt one point, Sheikh Hasina pointed to the IGP and said the police were doing well. The IGP replied that given the situation, it was not possible for the police to maintain such a strict stance for much longer.\n\nThe top officials tried to explain that force wouldn't solve the situation. However, Sheikh Hasina refused to accept this. The officials then discussed with Sheikh Rehana in another room and requested her to explain the situation to Sheikh Hasina. Sheikh Rehana then talked to her older sister, but Sheikh Hasina was adamant about holding onto power. At one point, a top official spoke to Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who was abroad, on the phone. Joy then spoke to his mother, and afterwards, Sheikh Hasina agreed to resign. She wanted to record a speech for the nation.\n\nBy then, intelligence reported that a large number of students and public were heading towards Ganabhaban from Shahbagh and Uttara. Considering the distance, it was estimated that they could reach Ganabhaban in 45 minutes. It was decided not to allow time for recording the speech as there might not be enough time to leave Ganabhaban. Sheikh Hasina was given 45 minutes to leave.\n\nSheikh Hasina then went to the helipad at the old Tejgaon airport with her younger sister Rehana. They loaded some luggage and then went to Bangabhaban. After completing the formalities of resignation, they flew towards India in a military helicopter around 2:30 PM with her younger sister.\n\nIt is known that the helicopter flew for a while after entering Indian airspace. It later landed at a BSF helipad in Agartala. From there, they went to Delhi, according to Indian media reports.\n\nAn India Today report said that Sheikh Hasina landed at Hindon Air Force Station near Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh) at 5:36 PM local time. An Indian Army officer welcomed her. It is known that she might go to London from there.\n\ntl;dr: Even at the last moment, Sheikh Hasina wanted to hold onto power through excessive force and more bloodshed. Yesterday, before leaving the country, she pressured top officials of various state forces for almost an hour from 10:30 AM. However, she refused to acknowledge that the situation was completely out of control. Later, after her family members persuaded her, she agreed to resign. She quickly resigned and secretly left the country with her sister Sheikh Rehana in a military helicopter.",

        "title": "A Letter to Young Bangladeshis",
        "body": "I was born abroad to Bengali parents of Muslim persuasion some 40 years ago. I was 17 when I traveled across India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh alone as a backpacker. I am a historian of South Asia and have a deep affinity for Bangladesh. Decided to build my business here in Dhaka in 2011 and have since spent most of my time in this country. I choose to live here.\n\nI do not look like a foreigner and I speak Bangla like a native. I wish to share my observations and some thoughts regarding the recent events, and provide some historical context.\n\nIf you are under 30, please take the time to read this.\n\nYoung people are disillusioned and demoralized. Many of you want the current government removed and replaced with 'something better' or 'literally anything else'. Many of you are simply fed up and just want to leave.\n\n# Generations\n\nThere are 4 generations of Bangladeshis who are alive today:\n\n* Those born before the Partition. The British Bengalis.\n\n* Those born between 1947 and 1971, a 24 year window. The Pak-Bengalis - they are likely your father's generation.\n\n* Those born post Liberation. Between 1971 and 1994. The First Bangladeshis and Millennials.\n\n* Those born around year 2000. The Gen-Z. If you are a school/college/university level student, you belong here.\n\nThe median age of a Bangladeshi is 25.9 years. The average Bangladeshi is Gen-Z.\n\nMore than a quarter of the population was born after 2010. 0-14 are 28.81%.\n\nAnother quarter was born after 1994. 15-30 are 27.82% the population.\n\nThis means that the Gen-Z are now the majority of the nation. If you are under 30, you are the absolute majority with 56.63%.\n\nThe First Bangladeshis and Millenials (1970-1994) constitute 31%\n\nThe Pak-Bengalis (and some remaining British Bengalis) are the remaining 12.34%\n\n# Politics\n\nYou probably hate politics and hate politicians.\n\nIf you were born on or after the year 2000, it is likely that Awami League and PM Sheikh Hasina are all you have seen and known.\n\nPolitics a game played by old people. The people in power, the politicians, the industrialists, the senior civil servants all belong the Pak-Bengali generation. Which means 12% are ruling over the 88%.\n\nYoung people, especially the Gen-Z are disconnected, disenfranchised by politics. You feel like hostages yearning for freedom.\n\nAs a historian, let me summarize the politics of Bangladesh since 1971:\n\n* Bangladesh was born amidst the height of the Cold War era where USA and USSR were playing geopolitical chess all over the globe. While the US (under Nixon) backed Pakistan and ignored the genocide, USSR and its ally India chose to carve out a new country - one under their sphere of influence.\n\n* Shortly after, the US strikes back (as Mujib was leaning more towards USSR) to replace the regime with a military dictatorship. The US preferred military dictatorships over communist regimes.\n\n* Bangladesh remained under US influenced dictatorships until 1991 when the USSR collapsed. The US then changed its tone: They were now exporting democracy.\n\n* The 1991 election was rigged by CIA (with the help of Pakistan's ISI) to put BNP (a party born in the Bangladesh Army cantonment) in power.\n\n* The political violence in 1996 was about Awami League leading the country in its fight for true democracy. In the end, they succeeded in forcing BNP to hold another election. They won because an overwhelming majority of Bangladeshis wanted Awami League and Sheikh Hasina. The irony is not lost on me.\n\n* BNP managed to come back to power in 2001 amidst another violent election season. This time, they were in a coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami. It was an era of unprecedented corruption when Bangladesh ranked the #1 corrupt country in the world three years in a row.\n\n* The violence was exactly the same as now. The Police always does their job: To maintain law and order, regardless of who is in power. At the time, Awami League was fighting the police.\n\n* Between 2001 and 2006, here are some more notable achievements: Hundreds of Hindu homes, businesses and temples were vandalized and burned by state-sponsored goons. The national railway system shrunk from 14,000 km to 12,000 km. Thousands of useless culverts were built.\n\n* The military takeover in 2006 which lasted until 2008 was also backed by the US. The army wanted to \"depoliticize\" the country by removing both Hasina and Khaleda from politics.\n\n* Sheikh Hasina sees the change in the geopolitical landscape and aligns with the US which, at this point, is aligned with India. BNP is now a party without a benefactor. This is why Awami League has ruled continuously since 2008.\n\nThe truth is that Bangladesh has never been a sovereign country. Your politics has always been governed by geopolitics. The parties and players have been mere pawns in a much bigger game.\n\n# Ideology\n\nThere are two competing political schools of thought in Bangladesh.\n\n## Bengali Nationalism \nwhich claims that the Two-Nation Theory, which partitioned British India into India and Pakistan, was nullified by 1971. What it means is that there are three nations, not two.\n\n* The third state, which is neither India nor Pakistan, is a secular democracy of the Nation of Bengal (Bangla Desh, as it was originally called). While India and Pakistan are ethnically diverse countries, Bangladesh is mostly Bengali. Bangladesh is unique - it is a nation-state unlike India and Pakistan (also Myanmar) which are multi-ethnic federations of states. It is the second most ethnically homogeneous nation on the planet after North Korea.\n\n* The concept of Bengali nationalism is rooted in the term \"Bhumiputro\" which means child of the land that is Bengal. Thus, Bengalis and Adibashi groups being classified as Bangladeshis.\n\n* Conceptually, the nation-state must be secular as religion plays a negligible role in state affairs. Everyone is equal under the law in a People's Republic.\n\n* The history of Bengali Nationalism dates back to 1905 and Awami League is the embodiment and progenitor of these ideas.\n\n* The Third Nation was proposed in the Cabinet Mission Plan before the Partition but Lord Mountbatten rejected the notion. It was supposed to be 3 Nations to be begin with.1952 was the people's rejection of the concept of Pakistan, less than 5 years after the Partition. The Bengali nation always wanted to be free.\n\n## Islamist Nationalism\nThe ideas set in motion by the Pakistan Movement and the Partition:\n\n* There are two nations: one for Hindus and one for Muslims of the subcontinent.During the Liberation War, the people who embodied this statement were the Razakars. \n\n* Since the re-introduction of Jamaat-e-Islami into Bangladesh politics by President Zia, they consider the Liberation War to be a setback and built a massive financial empire with hospitals and banks over the next two decades.\n\n* Despite the setback, the aim is to create an Islamic nation modeled after Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran. Pakistan was created on the basis of Ethnic Cleansing of the native Hindu population. The Punjabi Hindus, Sindhi Hindus and Kashmiri Pandits were cleansed. There are very few Hindus left in Pakistan.\n\nIn East Bengal, that is Bangladesh, however, Hindu cleansing never quite happened on the same scale as roughly 10% remain today, down from 30% in 1947 and 20% in 1971. But the attempt to \"Pak\" (clean) the land with religious persecution was made repeatedly and continuously.\n\nIt is also strange that 30% of West Bengal is Muslim so the population exchange did not quite work as the founders of Pakistan envisaged. Bengal was not really partitioned on the basis of religion, unlike Punjab where the Hindu-Muslim exchange was comprehensive.\n\nThis is due to the secular nature of your culture. You see, your nation went through an Enlightenment. The one you were made to forget. Your history starts from 1971, not 1947 or 1905 or earlier.\n\nNotice the distinction between Islamic and Islamist. Islamic refers to the faith and its personal and community rules while Islamist refers to using Islam as a political weapon.\n\nThese sets of ideas are older than your father. Probably older then your grandfather. These are forces you probably do not understand but feel around you.\n\nIt is important to remember that people do not have ideas; Ideas possess people.\n\n# Dreams\n\nYou aspire to live a country with decent quality of life. A place where you don't risk you life crossing the road. A place that is organized and clean. You do not see that around you, so you want to leave the country.\n\nDeep down, you envision a Bangladesh that is free and democratic like a developed Western nation.\n\nYou envision a country where human freedoms and dignity are absolute and where the purpose of the state is to enable, not suppress, those liberties.\n\nYou envision a city where it is safe to walk around, to drive around with your car, to be a cyclist, or to use the public transport.\n\nYou envision a clean environment where you can breathe freely.\n\nYou are the first generation in human history that is internet-enabled from birth, hence you envision the world - which leaves you disappointed with the current state of affairs.\n\nThe current state of affairs:\n\n* The 8th largest population in the world, highest population density.\n\n* In the top 5 most polluted countries\n\n* Dhaka among top 3 least livable cities among war-torn cities like Baghdad and Mogadishu.\n\nYour dreams are shattered every day, every time you open your eyes.\n\n# Thursday, 18th July 2024.\n\nThe unwarranted attacks on the demonstrating students and the firing of tear gas shells inside university grounds was particularly painful. The notable killings of Mir Mudgho from KU, Farhan Faiyaaz, Tahmid the Class 9 student, Mahfuz from BUP, Tanvin from IUT and many others. The news was spreading like wildfire in social media.\n\nBut the day got worse. By mid-afternoon hundreds of goons with sticks, machetes and makeshift weapons launched upon the streets to cause mayhem. The Police were helpless. Some had to lock themselves inside buildings while some were cornered and beaten up. The police cars were set on fire. Rampura-Badda DIT Road turned into a war zone.\n\nBy 6 P.M on Thursday, most of the student protestors had gone home due to the breaking news of the government coming half-way.\n\nThis is what happened after the students left:\n\nBy 7 P.M., the police had surrendered to the mob and left the scene. They had no choice.\n\nWe watched as men stormed the gate of BTV Bhaban and tore it down. Dozens of men stormed in to destroy every car, everything made of glass, and to set fire to anything flammable. We were helpless as smoke and fire engulfed large parts of the historic building that contains our national archive.\n\nA vengeful, angry, violent mob of a few hundred men ruled the streets, with thousands of locals (elakabashi) who simply watched; some were entertained. They did not look like students.\n\nIt was obvious these goons despise everything about Bangladesh. They will gladly burn this nation to the ground. They will destroy every civil structure, tear down the institutions, bring the economy to a grinding halt, and burn their way until they become kings of ashes and smoke.\n\nThe tokai population, the slum kids, were in charge of the looting. Everything made of metal, from road dividers, to bus stands, to burnt up cars, anything that can be sold for scraps was torn down with remarkable effeciency. Absolute anarchy.\n\nI was standing in front of main entrance of BTV Bhaban around 9 P.M., when I saw two men bring out a large oil painting of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from inside the building and place it on top of a bonfire in the middle of the road. A dozen men with sticks around me cheered as the canvas melted.\n\nThe Quota Movement was co-opted and turned into an insurrection by BNP-Jamaat. They people who wrecked havoc on the city were not students. They were opposition party \"neta-kormi\" (leaders-workers) who wanted revenge for the elections in January.\n\nI have not seen a civil war, but I have seen Rampura Bridge in 2024.\n\nThere is a distinction between protesting for rights, and burning down national institutions like the Metro Rail, BTV Bhaban, Expressway entrances, Shetu Bhaban, etc.\n\n# The State\n\nThe purpose of a state is self-preservation and growing in strength. In order to preserve itself, it must maintain law and order. The only method to apply law and order is to enforce a monopoly on violence.\n\nSuccessful states are built with strong inclusive institutions. It is all the government bodies, such as the Election Commission, the Anti-Corruption Bureau, the National Bureau of Revenue must operate within the law with efficiency and without political influence.\n\nViolent uprisings, destruction of national property creates the opposite: A Failed State. Breeding ground for terrorism.\n\nThere are many failed states such as Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, etc. where government institutions are non-existent or systemically broken.\n\nThe Police force are responsible for enforcing monopoly on violence, regardless of which party is in power. You see, the State and the Government are separate constructs. The government are the people we elect to enact laws and act as executives, whereas the State is all the civil servants including the police, the BGB and the armed forces.\n\nAre you protesting the State or the Government? Do you want to change the Government in order to reform the State? Or are you one of those anarchists who thinks burning down the State is what's needed to bring down the Government?\n\nWhat you are feeling is called Incumbency Fatigue - it is when we grow tired of the same people and their policies. Discontent grows the longer a government stays in power.\n\nLet's say, hypothetically, there appears a noble, incorruptible person who becomes the Prime Minister. What would you ask them to change? Try to be as specific as possible. What exactly would you change and why?\n\n# Geopolitics\n\nNo country exists in a vacuum. There are always outside powers that you must contend with in order to gain and maintain power.\n\nThe last 300 years of history has been the story of Western Civilization conquering and colonizing the world. The last 75 years have been about de-colonization and formation of nation-states.\n\nThe next 300 years will be the time of former colonies regaining their lost glory.\n\nChina has emerged as a superpower, India is on track to become another superpower. Both India and China are civilization-states that will find themselves among the top 3 countries in the world, along with the USA.\n\nEurope, the heart of the West, is finding itself in decline. The EU is at war with Russia and has major issues with mass migration, crime and declining standards of living.\n\nThe West is declining. The East is rising.\n\nFrom 1991 to 2015, the USA was the world's only superpower. We had a uni-polar world for brief period.\n\nSince the rise of China, the world is fragmenting again and becoming multi-polar.\n\nYou are undergoing a major change in the geopolitical landscape. The world has become quite unstable with escalations of war in Ukraine, Middle East and North Africa.\n\nA new geopolitical order will emerge within the next decade. Some countries will be winners, some will be losers.\n\n# Destiny\n\nBangladesh could very easily become a battleground for proxy war between great powers, USA and China and India.\n\nWe could end up as Somalia where those Thursdays are a regular occurrence. Throw in terrorist insurgency and repeated military coups, and we have a Failed State.\n\nBangladesh, the Basket Case and Failed State. Synonymous with floods, famine, civil war, terrorism and human suffering. Known globally as the Worst Country in the World.\n\nThis cannot be it, can it?\n\nFortunately, history and geography is Destiny.\n\n*What is your geography?*\n\n* You are the largest delta on planet Earth.\n\n* You are one of the few country with water abundance. Most countries don't have enough water.\n\n* You are the living on the most fertile land in the world. Despite being small, it feeds hundreds of millions.\n\n* You own the Bay of Bengal, the largest oceanic bay on the planet. You own fresh water ports, and a massive working age population.\n\n*What is your history?*\n\n* Are you not Bengal, the wealthiest nation in the Indian subcontinent until 1947?\n\n* Are you not East Pakistan, which was 55% of Pakistan's population and 60% of its economy?\n\n* Are you not Bangladesh, now 40% richer than Pakistan?\n\nIn 1750, the subcontinent comprised 25% of the world's economy, and Bengal contributed half of that. Have you forgotten that your nation was the wealthiest in the world for a thousand years?\n\nBy 1850, Bengal is the wealthiest of the British colonies.\n\nBy 1940, a united Bengal is the jewel on the British crown. The center of British imperial power in India. What Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow. The center-point of the Indian Civilization lies to the East.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1970, this land was raped repeatedly.\n\nThe Partition dismantled industry as raw materials were in the East and factories were in the West of the Radcliffe line.\n\nThe 24 years of being exploited by the Punjabi Army from West Pakistan. Stripped of its wealth.\n\nThe Liberation War wiped out the intelligent among you and left this nation with no institutions and uneducated, desperately poor masses.\n\nThe famines and floods and cyclones. The genocide. You became the Poorest Country in the World when you were born covered in blood.\n\nFrom the richest nation to the poorest in 30 years. This is the part of your history you were never told.\n\n# Hope\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of a successful state is Peaceful Transition of Power. Continuity of the Constitution and Rule of Law is the backbone of all rich countries.\n\nWhat if we figure out a new political movement that embodies the will of the majority, those born after Liberation?\n\nWhat if this political movement was unburdened by ideologies of the past and instead emphasized human progress, fighting corruption, educating the masses, and strengthening the nation?\n\nWhat if we figured out how to make our institutions strong? To hold elections on time and peacefully. Where participation is encouraged. Where good people who want change things step up into politics. Where political parties hand over power when their term expires, like a civilized country?\n\nWhat if 'politics' was no longer a dirty word?\n\nWhat if we accelerated our economic growth instead and become industrialized? With jobs and opportunities in every city, town and village.\n\nWhat if we were to increase our per capita income to 5000 USD? We know from other countries that upon reaching this benchmark, the environment drastically improves.\n\nWhat if we were the world's factory, like a Mini China? An industrial powerhouse that builds and exports everything from needles to engines.\n\nWhat if we became the financial center of the Global South, like a Mega Singapore? Chattogram coastline with skyscrapers.\n\nWhat if we were the 9th largest consumer market in the world? Bangladesh in the G-20, among the 20 richest countries?\n\nWhat if we were truly independent? A state with policy sovereignty.\n\nWhat if we were leading the world in education and research?\n\nWhat if we had first-class healthcare? Railways, roads and airports like the first-world?\n\nWhat if we had housing for the poor like Singapore and China?\n\nWhat if we cleaned up our cities and towns and made them livable?\n\nWhat if we could have one of the highest scores in HDI (Human Development Index) in Asia?\n\nWhat if we were winning gold at a Olympics and become one of the top 10 countries?\n\nWhat if Bangladesh was one of the top tourist destinations in the world?\n\nWhat if we could unite as a Nation? A nation with civic pride.\n\nDestiny is calling. Are you going to answer the call?\n\nDo not be demoralized. Rise.\n\nYou must rise because hope is all we have.\n\n------\n\nThis was a long essay. I have young nephews and nieces and in a way, I wrote this for them. Thought I would share this with Reddit.\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this. Feel free to AMA about history, geopolitics.",

        "body": "Due to increased taxation from ISP companies by Bashundhara, ISP association of Bangladesh has announced that all ISPs will temporarily cut off their internet connection in Bashundhara as a protest. As a result, the entire Bashundhara area didn't have access to WiFi for the whole day yesterday. Then they again closed internet at  9:30pm till 3pm next day. There could me more shutdowns.\n\nBashundhara also cracked down on Ghatpar for \"chada\", resulting in all the shops and restaurants there closing down as well, causing thousands of people to loose jobs. There are no parks, no shops - people in H/I block have to spend 80tk in rickshaw fare just to drink a cup of tea, and are forced to buy groceries from Mehedi Mart (owned by them) where everything's overpriced. They closed the pocket gate at Jamuna Future park. They have literally stolen lands from many landowners in N block, and shifted their plots to P block without their consent. People tried lawsuits against them, but none of it went anywhere. Its literally as if they're running a seperate country. Their owners get away with rape and kidnap charges. I even saw posters of Sayem Sobhan Anvir a few days ago. They own a lot of newspaper and tv channels which literally never post anything even remotely negative about Bashundhara or their owners. The only good thing about them is the security. The chairman of Bashundhara is even planning to stand for MP election in Narayanganj.\n\nBashundhara is one of the largest businesses in Bangladesh. So it is unfortunately expected that they will have this level of power in our country, regardless of the government.",

D activities, he narrated how they were trying to enlist services of non-resident Bangladeshi experts to overcome the shortage of quality teachers by paying them affordable consultancy fees.       \n\nThe VC also said that they were going to shift the university campus from the capital’s Tejgaon in July to its permanent site in Lalmonirhat, a northern town, over 300 kilometres from the capital.\n\n### Related Coverage:\n\n* [**›**  Bangladesh can be an aviation hub: CAAB chairman](https://www.newagebd.net/article/142017/bangladesh-can-be-an-aviation-hub-caab-chairman)\n* [**›**  Newly launched aviation and aerospace univ in Bangladesh to be world-class: VC](https://www.newagebd.net/article/125440/newly-launched-aviation-and-aerospace-univ-in-bangladesh-to-be-world-class-vc)\n\nNazrul Islam, who was appointed as the VC of the country’s lone aviation and aerospace university in July 2021, said that the entity had been giving research and development priority since its inception in February 2019.\n\nAccording to Nazrul, the lack of research has been a major reason for the country’s low progress in technology, he said.\n\nHe stated that the BSMRAAU was going to start building prototype single-engine light aircraft soon with assistance from the country’s Air Force.\n\nHangers and sites are ready for such aircraft while the import procedures for equipment will be completed soon, he also said.\n\nThe production of medium-range drones, which would be able to travel beyond 100 kilometres, has been made a priority for the institution, with emphasis on the development of nano satellites and rockets to capitalise on students’ enthusiasm for research and development.\n\nAlready, the fund for the R &amp; D component has been raised 10 times in the current financial year compared with the previous financial year, he said without disclosing the amount.\n\nAccording to the BSMRAAU VC, drones can be used extensively for agriculture and tourism purposes while the demand for the item in the maritime sector is also high.\n\nHe disclosed that they were also developing nano satellites and rockets.\n\n‘Rocket is an integral part of space science,’ he said, adding that they are advancing in this regard in a very methodical ways as rocket science is very critical.\n\nComputer modelling of rocket designs is under way after designs have been completed, he said.\n\nHe disclosed that they were also using help from the Air Force to run physical tests of rockets in the coming days. \n\nThe university, he went on to say, has entered into collaboration with a number of reputed universities, institutions, research centres and experts for all its four priority areas.\n\n‘We have signed MoUs with the Civil Aviation Authority, Bangladesh, leading industry manufacturers like the Airbus and Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group of Canada, higher educational institutions like Dhaka University, Cranfield University and the University of Surrey in the UK and Shenyang Aerospace in China to name a few,’ he said.\n\nHe also said that eminent Indian space scientist and former chair of Indian Space Research Organisation Professor AS Kiran Kumar, pro-vice-chancellor of Cranfield University Professor Dame Helen Atkinson and Professor Nazmul Ula of Loyola Maryland University of the US conducted sessions in training events.\n\nThe university has already built an antenna and set it on a rooftop on its makeshift campus in Tejgoan to begin to explore space science.\n\n‘It \\[the antenna\\] works as it can establish connection with satellites,’ said Nazrul Islam.\n\nHe said that they were getting good response from the non-resident Bangladeshi experts against a BSMRAAU request for taking classes at the university since consultancy fees of foreign experts are very high.  \n\nThe university is also going to arrange training for its teachers at foreign universities as they are determined not to compromise on the quality of teaching and training.\n\nHe noted that compromising on quality would not help them in translating the dream of making the university as a centre of excellent in the county’s aviation industry and space science.\n\nHe spoke high of the government decision to develop the university into an important international entity in the field of aviation and space science and technology in fulfilling the national aspirations set on the occasion of the country’s 50 years of independence.\n\nThe vice-chancellor noted that the country’s aviation sector was growing as in many other parts around the world.\n\nHe, however, lamented that the sector was dependent mostly on foreigners, forcing the country to spend foreign currency on their services.\n\nHe said that they were preparing to shift the university campus to Lalmonirhat in July.\n\nInitially, the undergraduate courses will be taken to the Lalmonirhat residential campus, facilitated by the Air Force, he added.\n\nNazrul Islam said that a development project proposal had already been submitted to the education ministry in connection with its permanent campus on the government allotted lands in the same city.  \n\nHe said that he was overwhelmed by the willingness from students for admission to the university.   \n\nAt present, the BSMRAAU has two batches of BSc in Aeronautical Engineering (Aerospace) and one batch of BSc in Aeronautical Engineering (Avionics) in the undergraduate programme.\n\nThe current graduate students of the university comprise two batches of MSc in Aviation Safety and Accident Investigation and MBA in Aviation Management and one batch of MSc in Aviation and Space Law.\n\nFrom July 2022, the BSMRAAU will start offering MSc in Space System Engineering and MSc in Satellite Communication Engineering.\n\nIt has also a plan to offer MSc in Autonomous Systems Engineering, MSc in Aeronautical Engineering (Aerospace) and Aeronautical Engineering (Avionics) from the academic year 2022-23.\n\nNazrul Islam expected that the higher science degree seekers would give high priority to the university in future.\n\nHe also expected that the number of students would reach 300 in June 2022 and 700 by 2025.",

        "body": "8 out of 10 times, the barbers fuck your hair up. These guys have no skills whatsoever and are rude as fuck. I gew out my hair carefully for the past 6 months. I used to get regular trims on the sides and back to keep it clean but everytime, something goes wrong slighly, usually not significant enough to see. Went to the my regular barber for a trim, but he wasn't present. Some other new guy cut my hair. I explained very intensively about how I want my hair cut. This guy was impatient from the beginning... Like he couldn't wait to finish and go jerk off to the Kolkata cinema playing on the TV. \n\nHe then disregards everything I said, and cut my hair into a hideous mullet. The sides short, but the nape area long. The front was reduced by a good few inches and layered so badly that the only way to fix it was to cut everything short. \n\nI then had a row with him, and he acted like he did me a favour cutting my hair. I stormed out of the salon throwing him the money out of rage and then went to another salon to fix my hair.\nHowever, the damage was done. This guy undid 6 months of growth and now I have a haircut which isn't bad. But it's way far from perfect. Barbers in BD suck.\n\nPS: Open for hair salon recommendations around banani/mohakhali/tejgaon",

D activities, he narrated how they were trying to enlist services of non-resident Bangladeshi experts to overcome the shortage of quality teachers by paying them affordable consultancy fees.       \n\nThe VC also said that they were going to shift the university campus from the capital’s Tejgaon in July to its permanent site in Lalmonirhat, a northern town, over 300 kilometres from the capital.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nNazrul Islam, who was appointed as the VC of the country’s lone aviation and aerospace university in July 2021, said that the entity had been giving research and development priority since its inception in February 2019.\n\nAccording to Nazrul, the lack of research has been a major reason for the country’s low progress in technology, he said.\n\nHe stated that the BSMRAAU was going to start building prototype single-engine light aircraft soon with assistance from the country’s Air Force.\n\nHangers and sites are ready for such aircraft while the import procedures for equipment will be completed soon, he also said.\n\nThe production of medium-range drones, which would be able to travel beyond 100 kilometres, has been made a priority for the institution, with emphasis on the development of nano satellites and rockets to capitalise on students’ enthusiasm for research and development.\n\nAlready, the fund for the R &amp; D component has been raised 10 times in the current financial year compared with the previous financial year, he said without disclosing the amount.\n\nAccording to the BSMRAAU VC, drones can be used extensively for agriculture and tourism purposes while the demand for the item in the maritime sector is also high.\n\nHe disclosed that they were also developing nano satellites and rockets.\n\n‘Rocket is an integral part of space science,’ he said, adding that they are advancing in this regard in a very methodical ways as rocket science is very critical.\n\nComputer modelling of rocket designs is under way after designs have been completed, he said.\n\nHe disclosed that they were also using help from the Air Force to run physical tests of rockets in the coming days. \n\nThe university, he went on to say, has entered into collaboration with a number of reputed universities, institutions, research centres and experts for all its four priority areas.\n\n‘We have signed MoUs with the Civil Aviation Authority, Bangladesh, leading industry manufacturers like the Airbus and Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group of Canada, higher educational institutions like Dhaka University, Cranfield University and the University of Surrey in the UK and Shenyang Aerospace in China to name a few,’ he said.\n\nHe also said that eminent Indian space scientist and former chair of Indian Space Research Organisation Professor AS Kiran Kumar, pro-vice-chancellor of Cranfield University Professor Dame Helen Atkinson and Professor Nazmul Ula of Loyola Maryland University of the US conducted sessions in training events.\n\nThe university has already built an antenna and set it on a rooftop on its makeshift campus in Tejgoan to begin to explore space science.\n\n‘It \\[the antenna\\] works as it can establish connection with satellites,’ said Nazrul Islam.\n\nHe said that they were getting good response from the non-resident Bangladeshi experts against a BSMRAAU request for taking classes at the university since consultancy fees of foreign experts are very high.  \n\nThe university is also going to arrange training for its teachers at foreign universities as they are determined not to compromise on the quality of teaching and training.\n\nHe noted that compromising on quality would not help them in translating the dream of making the university as a centre of excellent in the county’s aviation industry and space science.\n\nHe spoke high of the government decision to develop the university into an important international entity in the field of aviation and space science and technology in fulfilling the national aspirations set on the occasion of the country’s 50 years of independence.\n\nThe vice-chancellor noted that the country’s aviation sector was growing as in many other parts around the world.\n\nHe, however, lamented that the sector was dependent mostly on foreigners, forcing the country to spend foreign currency on their services.\n\nHe said that they were preparing to shift the university campus to Lalmonirhat in July.\n\nInitially, the undergraduate courses will be taken to the Lalmonirhat residential campus, facilitated by the Air Force, he added.\n\nNazrul Islam said that a development project proposal had already been submitted to the education ministry in connection with its permanent campus on the government allotted lands in the same city.  \n\nHe said that he was overwhelmed by the willingness from students for admission to the university.   \n\nAt present, the BSMRAAU has two batches of BSc in Aeronautical Engineering (Aerospace) and one batch of BSc in Aeronautical Engineering (Avionics) in the undergraduate programme.\n\nThe current graduate students of the university comprise two batches of MSc in Aviation Safety and Accident Investigation and MBA in Aviation Management and one batch of MSc in Aviation and Space Law.\n\nFrom July 2022, the BSMRAAU will start offering MSc in Space System Engineering and MSc in Satellite Communication Engineering.\n\nIt has also a plan to offer MSc in Autonomous Systems Engineering, MSc in Aeronautical Engineering (Aerospace) and Aeronautical Engineering (Avionics) from the academic year 2022-23.\n\nNazrul Islam expected that the higher science degree seekers would give high priority to the university in future.\n\nHe also expected that the number of students would reach 300 in June 2022 and 700 by 2025.",

        "title": "Did we actually hang the Rajakars responsible for '71",
        "body": "Okay, I would start off by saying that I do not support EITHER BAL or BNP.\n\n  \nRecently somebody posted an epic picture of the 2013 Shahbag Movement. This gave me an instant flashback to that period and I remembered the slogan \"Quader Mollah-r Fashi Chai\" &amp; \"Ekta Ekta Shibir Dhor, Dhoira Dhoira Jobai Kor\", the frequent unexpected closures of my school (which is perhaps the only thing I remember from then as I was too young). So this sparked my interest to visit this deep rabbit hole of Rajakars, Conspirators etc. and those who were accused and allegedly hanged as Rajakars. What sparked my interest, however, were the involvement of the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, that too DEFENDING these so-called killers. I mean, I have always known them to be true to the protection of Human Rights and Political Freedom, but this move made me question the entire thing. What's funnier is that many of the accused tried to plead to the court by saying that they got the wrong guy. For example, Quader Mollah's defence stated that the actual Quader who was the Rajakar was known as \"Koshai Quader\" and that same person isn't Quader Mollah.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now the real question, what did the ICT truly do? Did they get the right guys or was their intention to stir public opinion etc? I am not implying if anything happened, I am just asking what you may think. I too would like to see those animals get what they deserved for their actions, but then if those who were hanged were NOT the perpetrators, then have we served justice?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBtw I got all my info from Wikipedia + the referred links found there.",

All they do is religious preaching, and gaslight teenagers. they practically pay people to advertise them in groups. Yesterday I saw him publicly shame another doctor, and that's what struck me as odd - he did this before last year, right after something interesting happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe head of Lifespring practically is on a crusade against teenagers.\n\n* After Aurna Amin died, the lifespring guy (dr syedul ashraf) practically blamed it on girls going on roomdates\n* earlier this year he wrote about how it's our fault that our personality disorders make us rude against our parents\n* he blamed the other doctor (dr abrar) for 'ethically justifying teenagers wrongdoings'. On asking him he could provide no proof\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComing back to Dr Abrar\n\n* Last year he himself took down a fraud poser psychiatrist in a group. Right after it happened lifespring came after him saying he shudnt be allowed to practice. No proof\n* Earlier this year, a group of activists made a bunch of posts about dr abrar, making it look like an expose post. But all of them vanished and the profiles went inactive. No proof again.\n* Yesterday lifespring blamed dr abrar for being inexperienced, and for saying 'brutal stuff about senior doctors in facebook'. No proof.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've checked out this dr abrar, and he seems legit. Not only that, he's very precise and versed about issues that us young people go through. This guy has won awards and even setup a mental health system in a school in lalmatia for free. I knocked his page from a fake profile last night, and in 30 minutes he figured out my parenting issues, my personality, and even my partners personality.\n\nHe talked about my narcissism with absolutely zero judgement, told me its pros and cons, and how to keep it in check. And it wasn't even an appointment. I'll be honest, i've always hated therapists and called them manipulative shits but it was quite an experience being understood for once i guess.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is, why then does he draw a shitstorm like this? because he's competition? Because he looks out for us? Ppl like us always said that therapists dont understand us, and i was demonstrated that this guy does. So should we look out for him? Should we do something about that asshole sydul ashraf and lifespring? Bcz honestly there seems to be a syndicate of frauds gathering in this pandemic and if we speak up now we can shut them down\n\nlmk your thoughts",

To be precise, I’d like to get some information about Old Dhaka (that’s where my college is situated) and Shahbag (where I might live) \n\nI’d really appreciate it if you guys would answer some of my questions\n\n1. Are there any good accommodation options in and around Old Dhaka (apartments, hostels etc.)? Up until now the only reasonable place (i.e. equipped with facilities like A/C and Wi-Fi ) that I’ve found is Super Home BD which is located in Shahbag. \n\n2. I hear Old Dhaka is terribly congested. Do you guys have an idea of how long a morning (7:30ish) and an afternoon (~15:00) commute (Shahbag &lt;———&gt; Sir Salimullah/Old Dhaka)  might take and if it is even feasible to do so?\n\n3. For those in the know, what’s Sir Salimullah med college like? I mean does it have a positive/negative image in Bangladesh? \n\nPlease feel free to add anything else you might think is relevant or helpful.\nThanks",

        "title": "How did the current regime manage to stay in power for so long?",
        "body": "Courtesy - [Asif Shahan](https://www.facebook.com/asif.shahan.1)\n\n\nI think the political science students of the country should start focusing on one key question - a question that would be bothering the academics for years to come- how did the current regime manage to stay in power for so long (with no end in sight so far)? This is an interesting and puzzling question for one simple fact- since the transition to democracy in 1991 (and in fact, before that), all the political parties and leaders tried to to do this and failed. BNP tried to do that in 1996 in a thuggish manner and failed, AL was sure about its return to power for its ‘strategic decisions’ in 2001 and then was surprised, and BNP tried to follow AL’s strategy without success in 2006. The big question, therefore is- why did AL ‘succeed’? Is it just because its reliance on unprecedented use of coercive forces? Is it because of its attempt to introduce and initiate ‘us vs them’ ideology? Is it because of its ‘superior ability’ of making deal, bargaining and compromise? Is it because of its relationship and connection with the international actors? So called ‘development’? It’s ability to create, maintain, and sustain a winning coalition?\n\nWe don’t know and we need to know. But I think none of the factors mentioned above alone allowed the regime to survive. Its a complex interaction and I think the pure political scientists need to team up with the international relations scholars, economists and sociologists to unearth the logic of this regime’s survival. \n\nThe international relations scholars can tell us whether and how a changed international political order is willing to ‘tolerate’ the regime and is more than happy to buy its effort to legitimise itself while having a completely clear understanding that the ‘logic’ sold by regime is unrealistic.\n\nThe sociologists can tell us whether the societal structure has transformed significantly if compared with the 80s or 90s and whether or how this transformation is affecting the ebbs and few flows of social movements. \n\nThe economists can tell us whether a certain level of economic certainty really exists within the society and the market and whether and how the underlying economic condition is providing the necessary fuel to the regime.\n\nThe political scientists need to bring in their own understanding of the internal working process of the regime, blend that with arguments developed by the socio-economic and international relations scholars and tell us the complete story.\n\nIn my opinion, the current regime is guided by the following key ‘principles’ or ‘rules’ and even though these rules have made it ‘durable’, it has not made it ‘stable’. In other words, the rules that made this regime ‘successful’ in terms of staying in power has also made it extremely vulnerable.\n\n- The regime learned: from BNP’s efforts, it learned that raw action to implement the intention to stay in power may not work and from its failed effort, it learned that you have to be absolutely sure while relying on untested partners. \n\n- Drop ideological argument and be shamelessly flexible: I think this is the most important rule followed and applied by the regime. The current regime is neither liberal nor conservative- it can be extremely liberal when and if it wants and it can be extremely conservative if it needs to be. It facilitated Shahbag when it needed, did not hesitate to ‘kill’ the movement, it attacked Hefajat and then built a partnership with them. \n\n- Rights within boundary: The regime drew a boundary and allowed the citizens to do everything within that. It allowed citizens to talk, softly criticise, and even exercise a certain degree of freedom of expression and association but the rights enjoyed by citizens are ‘bounded rights’. It will not bother you as long as you stay within that line and not threaten the regime. When you understand that flexibility, and start testing the limits of that boundary- only then you are in trouble. \n\n- Ad-hocization: in my opinion, the regime doesn’t have a long-term political plan or understanding regarding how it can ensure its political survival. It does everything on a short-term basis. It takes every problem as it appears and uses its entire force to deal with that. It does not have any permanent friends or foes, it chooses its friends based on the situation, and is more than willing to change its friends into foes (or vice versa) if necessary. As a result, it managed to eliminate the options for its members of a winning coalition (thus, they can’t defect), forcing them to pledge loyalty only to the regime. As a result, it could keep the coalition short and manageable (dropping members from the coalition as needed) and ruled without having credible institutions that authoritarian leaders need to survive.\n\nAll of these rules lead to one goal and one specific goal- to survive and stay in power. That is the one motivation, one logic that motivated the regime. The current one is not aiming at creating a liberal or secular state neither a conservative or Islamic state- it can choose to do whatever it wants if that helps it to stay in power. It does not focus on development- development is an afterthought that happens as a by-product of maintaining a clientelist network. It will allow people to exercise their rights - be it freedom of expression and opinion- as long as it does not threaten regime survival. \n\nThis shameless flexibility, this ad-hoicization, this lack of any political planning or exit strategy is defining this regime, and this is creating the ultimate problem for this- at one end, it is trying to centralise and on the other, it cannot survive if does not rely on some key partners. But more on that later.",

        "title": "Have any of you radically changed your political views since childhood?",
        "body": "I grew up in a typical conservative middle-class household in the 90s. Like most conservative families, I grew up hearing about how horrible Sheikh Mujib became after 71, and how people were so relieved after he was murdered in 1975. This is something I heard from everyone, relatives, friends, etc. I, too, used to hate Sheikh Mujib. I thought he was a dictator, pro-India, anti-Islam, traitor, just wanted to be Pakistan's PM, etc.\n\nOf course, I was a teenager in the 2001-2006 period when the BNP-Jamat government rammed the entire country into the ground. There were hartals and oborodhs all the time, electricity used to go off every other hour, terrorist would blast a bomb every other week while the government would term it all as a \"conspiracy\", there was no development and we would stagger from one crisis to another. Mullahs would carry out misils all the time calling for Shariah law, and attacking Ahmadiyya houses. Khaleda Zia had zero control over the country. She just didn't have any leadership qualities. I felt that I wanted to leave this shithole as soon as I got the first opportunity.\n\nThe BNP regime was interrupted by the caretaker government. Full of \"highly educated\" bureaucrats, I naturally supported them. But their \"Minus 2\" plan went nowhere, and they weren't being able to handle the country either. Fakhruddin Ahmed and Moinuddin Ahmed just didn't' have any leadership qualities either. Facing an unfavourable situation, they at least had the decency to organize elections and arrange a respectable exit for themselves.\n\nThen we the Awami League get power in 2008. I still hated them back then. Their first term, 2009-2013 was full of turmoil, with the \"Shahbag movement\" and the \"ICT Tribunal\" and the hanging of the senior Jamat leaders. But the country gradually started getting into shape. If you look at the economic indicators we started taking off in 2010. By 2014 political stability was re-established. This was all possible due to Sheikh Hasina's leadership qualities, which others lack. The Awami League's electricity reforms paid off, and loadshedding is largely over in Dhaka. Awami League drastically reduced prices of broadband internet, and we got access to bufferless YouTube for the first time. BNP was jumping up and down screaming that government was looting crores of taka under the name of quick rental power plants. But our forex reserves zoomed from 10 billion to 30 billion. New roads were being built everywhere and Bangladesh's Debt-to-GDP ratio remains one of the lowest in South Asia, and in the world.\n\nSo I was really forced to re-evaluate my hatred of Awami League, Sheik Hasina and Sheikh Mujib. When I looked back at the life of Sheikh Mujib, I found that he dedicated his life to the people of East Bengal. He was a part of the Muslim League to get independence for us, and after witnessing the bloody religious riots changed his worldview to secular democratic socialism. That's something very admirable! That's not anti-Islam at all! And then he joined forces with India to free East Pakistan. That's not treason, his loyalty was to the people of East Pakistan. He single-handedly united 60 million very backward and uneducated people and led them to independence. After that, he presided over the creation of a Constitution that was secular, in a overwhelmingly rural, uneducated Muslim country. He could easily have given in to Saudi Arabia in return for oil, like so many Muslim countries, but did not compromise. He could have chosen to recognize Israel, and have gotten instant recognition and support from the West, but stayed firm to his principles of loyalty to the Palestinian people. All of his actions point towards the qualities of a great leader. Sheikh Mujib did not allow the Indians to stay in Bangladesh and ensured their withdrawal.\n\nJust have a look at countries around the world today. Look at Syria, where they have a bastard dictator who murders his own people, and an opposition full of traitors and terrorists. Look at Libya, where the people have no leadership. Look at India, where they are under the thrall of a fascist religious dictator Modi. Sudan is only establishing secularism in their constitution in 2020, while Bangladesh did it 50 years ago!!! Look at Iran, where people are all trying to escape their religious government. Look at Pakistan with their blasphemy laws and their mullahs trying to oppose any law against child marriage! We bypassed all of this thanks to Sheikh Mujib and his foresight!!!\n\nThe closest leader who resembles Sheikh Mujib would be Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. While Ataturk was objectively greater than Sheikh Mujib, since he was an accomplished military leader who led the actual Turkish War of Independence himself, Ataturk also modernized a backward, rural, uneducated nation overnight into a modern, secular and democratic state. Of course, Ataturk has many haters. They also accuse him of being a dictator. But his achievements greatly overshadow any sacrifices that may have been required to achieve the goal of a modern independent Turkey. The same goes for Shiekh Mujib. Whatever are his faults, Rakkhi Bahini, BAKSAL, I am willing to forgive him for his leadership during our independence and his creation of a secular and democratic Bangladesh.\n\nToday we are blessed to have his daughter Sheikh Hasina in power. Lots of you might call her \"fascist\". That's such a lazy and pathetic position to take. Trust me, if there was any other leader other than SH as PM the government would be just as \"fascist\" as her government is now. Its so easy to sit back behind a PC and cry \"fascist fascist fascist\". YOU try organizing a political party in a nation of 165 million people, and then successfully leading that country on the path towards economic development. Without a doubt, if those crying 'fascist fascist' were put into power as PM they would be 100 times more fascistic than Sheikh Hasina is right now.\n\nWithout a doubt, human rights abuses occur under her. Abrar was beaten to death by BCL thugs (which was fully supported by the 'humanist' Taslima Nasrin btw). But those BCL thugs are in jail now. Major Sinha Rashed Khan was murdered by OC Liakat and Prodip. Both of them are in jail. If SH was as fascist as people claim, they would be out in the streets, like the Hindu thugs who carried out the Delhi riots in February, or the terrorist Mullahs in Pakistan who forcibly convert and kidnap Christian girls.\n\nSo, from what I have seen, Awami League is an organic political party of the people of East Bengal. They have deeper roots in the hearts of the people than any other political movement. And they should be lauded because they have established secularism and inclusive nationalism where there is space for Bangladeshis of all religions and ethnicities in a united Bangladesh. While sometimes they have acted in a fascist manner, it is excusable because there is no other alternative in Bangladesh who can win elections and be more liberal than BAL. Instead of pathetically criticizing them, those who want the best for Bangladesh should work with them in order to reduce the human rights abuses which do still occur. BAL will be remembered in history like the PAP of Singapore, or the UMNO of Malaysia, or the Chinese Communist Party; all of whom were authoritarian, who were accused of being fascist, but ultimately ensured the evolution of their societies from backward uneducated agricultural societies to modern, secular democratic industrial ones.",

        "body": "We saw in 2013, when Hefazat arose after it was revealed that some of the organizers of the 2013 Shahbag protests were deeply anti-Muslim, that the Awami League took a hard line against them. They forcibly displaced them from Shapla Chattar on May 5 and filed cases against many of their leaders. They also became a laughing stock when some of Allama Shafi's lectures were publicized where he had made lots of misogynistic comments like girls should not be educated past class 5, etc.\n\nHowever, after AL won the elections in 2014 suddenly they became very close to Hefazat. Sheikh Hasina ordered moving the statue from in front of the Supreme Court on their demand, textbooks were changed allegedly on their demands, the Qaumi Dawra-e-Hadith degree was given equivalency to a Masters degree, something which progressives criticized the BNP severely for when they attempted to do it.\n\nMeanwhile, Hefazat has grown in confidence and are poisoning Bangladeshi society (especially rural society) with their backward beliefs, which sometimes lead to atrocities like attacks on minorities after an allegation of 'blasphemy', or digging up Ahmadiyyas from graves. \n\nEducated Bangladeshi society is almost unanimously against Hefazat. Even BNP were hesitant to openly support Hefazat. They have no popularity among educated people. If Sheikh Hasina wanted then she could even hang Allama Shafi like she did with Jamat. \n\nSo why is Sheikh Hasina indulging Hefazat? Does she have a soft spot for Allama Shafi? Why isn't Awami League working to limit their influence, since Hefazat's beliefs clearly go against the fundamental values of the Bangladeshi Constitution and are an impediment towards Vision 2021/2041/whatever?",

They just took down the GD, but I got the impression they are not going to actively investigate or follow up. They didn’t guide me on what steps I should take next or whether they would try tracking the phones.\n\nNow I’m feeling stuck and unsure about what I should do.I know the chances of getting the phones back may be slim, but I still want to try every possible step instead of just waiting. Any advice, especially from people in Dhaka or Bangladesh who dealt with this kind of situation, would be really helpful.\n\nThanks in advance for your suggestions.\n",

I usually travel alone to meet her, and after hanging out, I drop her off at her home in the evening.\n\nSo far, I haven’t faced any dangerous situations, but recently I’ve read a few posts saying that Keraniganj isn’t very safe, especially at night. That got me a bit worried.\n\nIs it actually unsafe to travel there alone in the evening? Should I stop meeting her like this, or is it fine as long as I’m careful?

Research Paper has never been a part of curriculum there. Which is why most of the teachers always gave me negative inputs and Jungle looks whenever I mentioned that and asked from their help. \n\nWe all know what kind of credibility these papers enhance to one's profile when it comes to Research Papers. \n\nHowever, for the last few years I did approach to many research scholars just to teach me, guide me, and help me with that. Some would go silent on day 2, some would ask money, some present that as a rocket science and make me feel that it is not for everyone, I should not run after it. Tried learning it from the YouTube and online available articles, but I still have not been able to get a grip on that. I even once paid a guy 13,000 Taka who promised to guide me, that guy took the money gave me a ChatGPT manuscript and disappeared into thin air. \n\n  \nI don't think I need to say anything more that how desperate I am about this thing. However, I am here in the group, spreading my hands and asking for help! It will really mean a lot to me if someone really understands this pain of mine and help me genuinely taking through the process.\n\nThank you very much!",

Ive had my parents try contacting some nearby animal rescue teams but they havent responded and we're getting desperate. Nobody else in the area is doing anything either and taking her to the vet by ourselves to get her euthanized isnt possible either and quite risky. The poor baby has been suffering nonstop and this also poses as a safety hazard for the people in the area and other dogs. If there's any animal rescuer here whos willing to help please feel free to reach out, ill be glad to provide the details.",

        "title": "Living and working in BD with a full-sleeve tattoo and broader sociopolitical implications (just my opinionated two cents really)...",
        "body": "So, a bit about myself first – I’m in my early thirties, working as a consultant for a handful of govt. projects supported by multiple foreign donors, MNCs, and INGOs. All my consultancies combined, I earn well enough in any country’s context I’d say (mid-tier six figures)…family home is at Dhaka Cantonment and I’ve got my own residence (rental) at I’d say a somewhat upscale neighbourhood in the heart of the city…so I went to high-school at a reputable English medium academy here, and lived abroad prior, and pursued higher education abroad as well…\n\nNow keep in mind, I dress a certain way outside of work but socialize (and I mean SOCIALIZE, not “mingle”) with people from almost every socioeconomic background and literacy-level, and this experience in Bangladesh is positively surreal and unlike anything else anywhere in the world! Now, my experiences are not a microcosm of how things are or what to expect in the near future so I’m just gonna leave it up for interpretation and try my best to not make it political…\n\nBut in a nutshell, if anyone saw me outside of work, you’d be hard-pressed to pinpoint what exactly my profession is with my tattoos and piercings and how I dress since a lot of it is shaped by my upbringing and time-spent outside of the country…\n\nAnyway, through work, I’ve had the opportunity to rub shoulders with mid-senior level people from numerous GoB institutions and intel agencies. To this day there are certain people from ministries and intel agencies that don’t even know I’ve got a full-sleeve tattoo coz they’ve never seen me with my sleeves rolled up or not in a blazer. They know I’ve got piercings but obviously I don’t wear em at work so its no biggy…Honestly there is a fear factor and notion of judgement at play here because I know for a fact that if these people ever found out, they would not take it positively, perhaps even altering their perceptions of me…here’s the kicker – these people comprise absolute degenerates BY LARGE! these are the very same people I’ve been to bars and parties with and got absolutely hammered, and these very same degenerates FROM ministries, FROM law enforcement and intel agencies, and FROM the military include people who prey on barely legal teens at bars and hotels, while having daughters of the same age back home…let that sink in…It’s a lot like modh khawar agey Bismillah bola…they engage in some of the scummiest shit you can comprehend on a regular basis but amar tattoo dekha equals a huge Astagfirullah…I got this vibe from some of the conversations we’ve had. Keep in mind, these are the people PRESENTLY in power via proshashon, LEAs, and the military. So this is not a political narrative on who’s in power and who’s got better access at present vs how things were under BAL. its purely and I mean PURELY people-oriented. I dealt with these very same types of degenerates and witnessed their degeneracy first-hand before jul-aug’24, and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING has changed as these things largely stem from positions of power and power trips. Anyway, my point is I gotta be cautious about my outward appearance around these people while also bearing witness to their degeneracy and keeping my mouth shut and im happy to do so but it’s a minefield honestly. I find some solace in the fact that I’ve got dirt on them tho (not that im gonna do anything with it)!\n\nIn stark contrast, also through work, I’ve had the privilege of socializing with akdom e goi-graam er communities…So, when iam out at the “Field”, I dress for comfort so goi-graam er jader kotha bollam my tattoos have NEVER been an issue for them, nor have I ever faced one-off odd comments. Now even though I absolutely 100% look Bangladeshi, people from the grassroots engage in harmless curiosity and largely assume im some kinda foreigner until I open my mouth and surprisingly enough, this helps establish a far more intimate and transparent rapport in a lot of ways…now that narrative might be a bit biased coz I’ve got regional partners around me so obviously there’s a layer of filter at play when im talking to someone from the grassroots. Regardless, by large, the tats have never been an issue.\n\nComing to my social life beyond work now…\n\nSo the areas I mentioned above may give you an idea of where I mostly spend my free time with friends and families. Like I said after 530 PM you’re not gonna be able to pinpoint what my profession is! Anyway obviously the tats haven’t been an issue in Gulshan-Banani-Bashundhara-Dhanmondi, etc. like, ever! Surprisingly tho, it’s a lot of expats that raise an eyebrow when meeting me for the first time. SOMEHOW, a full sleeve tat on a Bangladeshi who looks Bangladeshi is a bit of a cultural shock I guess for a lot of expats (think European shada chamras basically). Again, harmless curiosity coz the questions are mostly limited to is my family okay with it, what religion do I belong to, do I get odd stares or comments on the regular, but recently tho – IS IT SAFE to expose your sleeves right now…more on this later!\n\nNow with my friends and all we routinely drive outside of Dhaka especially over the weekend or engage in social activities and what not, the usual Gulshan-Banani shit. These are some of the most astonishingly progressive, liberal, intelligent minds from BD’s private sector honestly. Recently, I’ve seen a shift in how they perceive my outward appearance tho. So when driving to Cox’s Bazar last month, we stopped at this reputable roadside restaurant. The females of the group refused to let me out of the car with my sleeves exposed to the point je I had to borrow one of their shirt and put it over my T, covering my sleeve in the process. In essence their fear was of me drawing unwanted attention from sketchy-looking people who’d in turn comment on the group as a collective and the situation can potentially escalate from there…this is a common concern among my friends and associations at present. Now, I went to DU post-DUCSU as well and it was great to see the open-air concert-ish ayojon infront of Janata Bank with people from all walks of life in attendance. I have never, not once, faced an odd-comment or a situation that could have escalated at DU – during the BCL era or post july-aug. Been there with girls, guys and everything in between, been at Uddan with potheads, done it all really coz I know some proper non-political alums who in turn know choto-bhais there at present. Nor have I ever faced a threatening situation or one that can potentially escalate ANYWHERE in Bangladesh…nor have I ever been faced with an odd/out of the place comment about my tats…\n\nSo why am I saying all this? Honestly as of recent I see a LOT of polarization in mostly young people about the direction this country is in and where its headed…this largely stems (AND RIGHTFULLY SO) from one political party imposing an ideological agenda, while another one’s gonna go down the exact same road BAL did. So with the former, the fear is on the infringement of basic rights and freedom – freedom to dress, to express, and to explore, especially amongst the women. I am not gonna comment on how justified this is coz just as an example, I believe the vast majority of educated, liberal, progressive minded people entirely missed the bigger picture from DUCSU. Anyway this is a conversation for another day maybe…  \n  \nBut since we see a lot of people raising some very valid concerns, I too thought I’d share my limited experiences from living and working in this country I love so dearly! Keep in mind I am someone who will be public enemy # 1 if the narratives about a certain political party coming to power are even 10% true and based. This includes my work life AND my social life…I’ll be very honest I’ve been living and working here for about six/seven years now and in my case and that of my immediate circles at least, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING has changed. Not a single right we uphold has been infringed or imposed upon, never an odd or out of place comment, never a situation that needed to be escalated in any way. Is it from a point of privilege? ABSOLUTELY…but its also a viewpoint just like the countless others that raise some very important and concerning points as well. What has changed tho? Before july-aug, I’d have to be careful with politically sensitive and incendiary statements and now, religious/ideological statements. But me standing out like a sore thumb and raising eyebrows and questions has not changed at all and as long as my outward appearance does not invite trouble with any politically/ideologically minded person, my work and social life is gonna keep going in exactly the same way.\n\nDoesn’t it seem out of place to you guys that amra jei desh e fundamentalism er rise dekchi, shei same desh e literally Thailand-style full moon parties hocche at the same time, openly UNIMAGINABLE levels of D-E-G-E-N-E-R-A-C-Y hocche on the regular, progressiveness er naam e ja iccha tai hocche…? But yes I will admit, its all happening in select-few, fringe circles who actually hold a lot of wealth and power and SAY in important stuffs…so the problem isn’t radicalization by large it is inequality and the HUGE disparity between people who live a very progressive and liberal lifestyle, and those who cannot even comprehend those kinda lifestyle.\n\nSo let me ask a couple of questions – do you think every segment of society will be equally affected if radicalization gets a proper foothold here? People from every walk of life will be equally effected? If the answer is NO, then how will there be a balance between what the progressives and liberals want and what those with far less access and dare I say literacy will have to endure? Who will accommodate this balance and how exactly? Will the country’s booming private sector (local and mncs) have absolutely no say coz if the country’s governed by fundamentalists, its just bad for business overall…hundreds of thousands representing these sectors will simply stay quiet and do nothing? What about the thousands of women employed in the private and informal sectors? Suppose the absolute extreme happens and women are forced to cover up and stay at home. How will these sectors and companies sustain after massive layoffs? And these women with access with wealth and power will do absolutely nothing if their rights are overtly infringed upon? They wont take to the streets? And what exactly will that fundamentalist political party do in response? Cane them, beat them to a pulp, shoot and kill them? And you think any of these wont invite international pressure in any way?...\n\nI honestly think there are a LOT of factors that people are failing to consider or comprehend when stating things like the country’s going to hell and we’ll be the next Afghanistan, etc etc. Me personally, I have learnt to survive here JUST LIKE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD, through sheer common sense and being aware and perceptive of my surroundings. Let me give you another example then – lets say you’re dripped in jewellery and a 500k watch, taking a stroll through Englewood, Chicago at saaay one at night. You get mugged. There is not a soul who will feel a semblance of sympathy for you. You will be ABSOLUTELY TO BLAME for being so dense and carefree. It is the same notion of common sense you can live by in Bangladesh and completely avoid situations that may put you in danger, regardless of who’s in power. People SUCK everywhere, including here. Sure its made worse by illiteracy but people just SUCK everywhere on earth.\n\nThat’s all I gotta say honestly hope I made sense?? Somehow? And thanks for reading all of it!!!",

        "body": "Hello everyone on Reddit,\nI hope this post finds you in a better place than I'm in right now.  I'm a 33-year-old father from Bashundhara Riverview Housing, Keraniganj,  Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have two beautiful daughters – my little angels, aged 3.5 and 7 – who light up my world even on the darkest days. But lately, those days have been too dark, and I'm reaching out here as a last resort, feeling utterly helpless and scared for my family's future.\n\n\nFor the past few months, I've been without a job. Our family's monthly expenses hover around BDT 25,000 – covering rent, food, school fees for my older daughter, and the basics to keep us going. \n\nBut with no steady income, everything's falling apart. I haven't been able to pay our house rent on time, and our electricity bills have piled up for the last three months. \n\nThe landlord is losing patience, and the power company has warned us about cutting off the line any day now. \n\nI can't even imagine telling my girls why the lights won't turn on or why we might have to leave our home in Bashundhara Riverview Housing Area, Keranigonj. It's breaking my heart just thinking about it – they're so innocent, and they deserve stability, not this constant worry.\n\nLast month, I posted here on Reddit sharing my struggles, and a couple of kind souls – 2 or 3 wonderful people – stepped in to help. They sent money that allowed me to buy food for my family when our cupboards were bare. I'm forever grateful for that compassion; it gave us a glimmer of hope.\n\n With part of that help, I invested in starting a small homemade street food business right in my area – simple things like fuchka,  chotpoti, momo etc that we make ourselves . \n\nIt's been a way to hustle and feel like I'm doing something, but the profits are barely a quarter of what we need each month. It's not enough to cover our bills or keep the roof over our heads. And while people helped with immediate needs, no one was able to connect me to a job, which is what I truly need to turn things around.\n\nI'm not just asking for handouts – though any help to pay these overdue bills would be a lifesaver right now, even if it's just enough to keep the lights on or settle part of the rent. What I'm really hoping for is a job opportunity around BDT 25,000 per month. \n\nI'm dedicated, reliable, and ready to work hard in roles like assistant librarian, HR officer, legal associate, or lab assistant – fields where I've built solid experience over the years.\n\n\nHere's a quick look at my background (I've attached my resume below for more details):\n\nEducation: LL.M from Bangladesh University of Professionals (2022), \nDiploma in Library &amp; Information Science from National University Bangladesh (2021), \nLL.B from Bangladesh Open University (2019).\n\n\nWork Experience:\nAssistant Librarian at MEH Arif College, Gazipur (Sep 2024 - June 2025) – Managed library operations, supported students and faculty.\n\nLegal Associate at Counsel De Legal, Dhaka (Mar 2024 - July 2024) – Handled legal research, drafting, and client support.\n\nHR Officer at Prime Washing Plant Ltd, Narayanganj (Jan 2023 - Dec 2023) – Developed employee tracking systems, handled complaints, and created handbooks.\n\nLegal Associate at Advocate Al-Amin &amp; Associates, Dhaka (Mar 2022 - Dec 2022) – Researched and drafted legal docs, advised clients.\n\nLab Assistant at Morning Glory School &amp; College, Savar Cantonment (Aug 2013 - Sep 2021) – Supported academic labs.\n\nPharmacy Lab Assistant at BGC Trust University Bangladesh, Chottogram (Nov 2012 - Aug 2013).\n\nSkills: Legal research and drafting, Microsoft Office, library management, time management, teamwork. Fluent in English and Bangla, with a professional light vehicle driving license.\n\nI'm versatile, adaptable, and committed to giving my all. If you or anyone you know has openings in Dhaka or nearby – in education, admin, legal, HR, or even something entry-level – please reach out. I can start immediately and promise to be an asset to any team.\n\n\nIf you can help with the bills in the meantime, even a small amount via bank transfer or whatever works, it would mean the world. My contact details: Email - aftabhamidlaw@gmail.com , Mobile number:   +8801745688837( Bkash/Nagad) . I'm happy to verify anything or chat more.\nYou've shown me kindness before, and I'm praying that same spirit touches someone today. My daughters are my everything – their smiles keep me going, but I can't do this alone anymore. Any advice, leads, or support would be a blessing. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading this.\nWith hope,\nA H",

        "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nCurrently I’m using **Carnival Internet**. They are charging me **৳1,599 for 75 Mbps**.  \nNow I want to cut down my budget – they said if I downgrade, they’ll charge me a **৳2,000 downgrade fee**.\n\nI checked some other ISPs (like **Dot, Triangle, MiME, Link3,** etc.) and found that many of them offer **60-75 Mbps around ৳1,100–1,200/month** with lower installation fees compared to Carnival.\n\n📍 **My location:** Tejgaon, East Nakhalpara.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* How is the real experience with **Dot, Triangle, MiME, Link3** (or other ISPs) in this area?\n* Is it better to pay Carnival’s downgrade charge and stay, or should I switch to a different ISP?\n* Any recommendations for stable ISP service in East Nakhalpara?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Where do you actually enjoy walking or passing by? From where you can romanticise the city for a bit?  \n\nFor me, it’s the Hatirjheel–Rampura bridge in the evening, (I always take that bike route while going home from office) when you can see the skyline and another one is the elevated expressway (in the evening/night) when you can see the entire city from there.

        "title": "Rant: Bashundhara R/A is an absolutely horrendous neighborhood. Why is it so \"hyped\"?",
        "body": "TL;Dr – this is a rant. Just me bitching about how much of a shit hole Bashundhara is. Nothing really to discuss tbh.. but feel free to join me on the Bashundhara hate train if you also hate it. \n\nI'm currently staying in Bashundhara, and EVERY single day I'm dumbfounded that people actually INTENTIONALLY planned this fucking place, and it's still so trash? Literally the most poorly designed and inconvenient place I've been to in Dhaka. My graamer bari feels like a more practical place to live than this shithole. \n\nI thought I was biased due to the \"privilege\" of having grown up in Dhanmondi (before moving abroad). But the people living here seem WAYYY richer and privileged than anyone I knew from dmd let alone me lol.... I literally see Audis and other luxury cars here daily.. some even with foreign number plates driving around L-block or K-block (they don't even have roads there bruh). WTF? You're telling me you can afford that shit and still CHOSE to live in this dumpster?\n\n1. Besides 2-3 \"clusters\", there are literally no amenities in the area. Just fucking houses upon houses.. as if it's an American suburb. You have to go all the way to JFP or near Rupayan or around I-block for groceries, restaurants, clinics, barbers, pharmacies or literally any service. The supermarkets (both shwapno &amp; meena bazaar) also usually have fewer products than other locations.\n\n2. 80% of the roads don't have any footpath, making walking around extremely annoying (especially with the narrow af roads). Hell, in the further blocks they don't even fucking have ANY roads. Just mud... Even in the \"nicer\" blocks where there are some footpaths, they're often broken and full of construction sand all the time. Also what's with the lack of streetlights? It's all so dim everywhere.. even where they have lights they're so dim and obnoxiously designed. \n\n3. You can barely find rickshaws.. and when you find one they frequently refuse to go. Literally in no other place is it this hard to hail a ride. Not to mention the fucking prices.. can't go anywhere for less than 60tk AT LEAST. Heck.. it's even hard to get a fucking Uber to accept the ride to/from Bashundhara.\n\n4. Access to public transportation is also fucking abysmal. You need to haul your ass from the middle of nowhere for like 15-20 mins to get buses.. unless you live near JFP. But if you're near JFP, then that means being cursed with perpetual traffic on Progoti Shoroni.\n\n5. Speaking of being near JFP.. is that a mall or new market? The road is already narrow AF, and half the road is taken over by street sellers. It's NEVER free of traffic. \n\n6. I get it it's a \"gated community\" or whatever.. but driving into Bashundhara late at night is literally like playing russian roulette with the gates. If you end up on a closed one, you gotta drive your ass ALL the way through 300 ft to find an open gate. What stupid fucking logic is this? \n\n7. Correct me if I'm wrong but there are no schools here except ultra-expensive English medium schools? What the heck? You're telling me EVERYONE here goes to EMs? It's not like that even in Gulshan or Dmd.\n\n8. And only one hospital that happens to be the most expensive in the country? In this shithole?\n\n9. Where are the mosques? In no other place have I seen this few mosques, and those that exist are TINY.. just one floor most of the time and super ugly too. Is this even BD?\n\n10. The first time I visited Bashundhara like 7-8 years ago, I fell into a ditch cuz it was so dark and roads were dug out everywhere. Still pissed about that so I might be a little extra biased against this place lol.\n\nLiterally the ONLY thing that feels \"good\" about Bashundhara is that it is relatively safe for Dhaka. \n\nSo why is Bashundhara so \"hyped\".. often being grouped with Gulshan/Banani as the \"nicer\" areas of Dhaka when its clearly not even 10 leagues near Gulshan/Banani?? \n\nIs it because someday the land/house prices are expected skyrocket here when its more developed? If so, what benefit do renters get.. why do so many ppl want to rent here? It's not like rent is particularly cheap there. \n\nTbh, this whole area honestly feels like Mohammadpur 2.0 in the making 20-30 years from now. Super dense and congested residential blocks with little to no mixed use spaces.. it just doesn't feel as physically suffocating yet because its underdeveloped af, but it sure does feel extremely suffocating living here after coming from Dhanmondi.\n\nI live in the US and hate suburban sprawl with a damn passion. Literally THE WORST thing in the US in my opinion. Bashundhara just feels like it's trying hard to replicate that but make it shittier and ditch the good parts while at it. \n\nThanks for reading my rant. Bye.\n\n\n\n",

They mean everything to me, the reason I keep fighting.\n\nI’ve worked my heart out, earning my Honours, Master’s, and PGD, dreaming education would secure a future for us. But life hit hard—I lost my job, and now every day is a struggle to feed my kids, keep them safe, and see them smile.

My family's financial situation was okay before, but recently things have taken a turn.  high tuition and living costs are becoming a burden on my father, and I really want to do something to help.\n\nI’ve started learning some skills for freelance work, but as you know, that takes time. So I thought of doing tuition in the meantime. The problem is, I have no prior experience and I’ve always been more of an introvert, avoided people a lot. Even so, I tried reaching out through local tuition groups on social media, but no luck so far.\n\nI’ve heard that having friends recommend you for tuition helps, but I don’t know many people yet—I’m just in my 3rd semester.\n\nOther than tuition, do students here do part-time jobs like café work, coaching center jobs, etc.? If so, how do I even start looking for those? Any tips or places to check or maybe advice would be appreciated.",

        "title": "The protesters are throwing rocks, that’s why the coordinator’s forces are ordering to shoot the protesters and dump their bodies. This is exactly how they carried out the Gopalganj massacre.",
        "body": "https://reddit.com/link/1m3pazw/video/s8p1p62bzrdf1/player\n\n[Video Source](https://www.facebook.com/arman.b.rashid/posts/pfbid02baNJFftNjtavSzpJNKUPWWaPYaNVKBdriVmzMdxShvo9DBMc8XWQimx7EmDXdpaql) \n\nThis 32‑minute video will remain a documentary proof of the militant activities of NCP leaders and activists, carried out with full assistance and protection from the administration.\n\nIn every conversation within the video, it is revealed what plans they had when they came to Gopalganj and what their next plans are. Throughout the entire video there were tirades against the Awami League, Mujib, and Gopalganj, along with incitements, various threats, and murder plots.\n\nWhile still in the car, they sent instructions to Dhaka to block the Dhaka–Chittagong highway in front of Jatrabari Donia College. They discussed that next time when they come to Gopalganj they would even dig up Bangabandhu’s grave. Many different militant plans came up in these conversations but above all what became clear is that—starting from top‑level administrative support to coordination with the army and army intelligence—everything is being implemented with their help, and in the same way all preparations for the future will also be made.\n\nSome key excerpts from the video are described below:\n\nThe video was recorded from one of the cars in the middle of the NCP motorcade while they were fleeing Gopalganj. The main narrator is NCP Madaripur district coordinator Rakib Hasan. Also present in the car were NCP Madaripur’s chief coordinator Shahidul Islam and four others.\n\nRight after the beginning, the convoy encountered a barricade and was seen being pelted with bricks and stones by 5–6 people from Gopalganj. One brick hit the car and shattered one of the side windows (though later they tried to portray that brick as a crude bomb). At that time, everyone inside the car started shouting why the attackers weren’t being fired upon on their behalf and demanded that if the army wouldn’t shoot, then weapons should be handed over to them.\n\nAt 3 minutes 20 seconds, Rakib is heard saying regarding why the army isn’t firing:\n\n“They’ve been given full access to fire, but not a single shot has been fired.”\n\nThis clearly reveals that the army had been ordered to shoot people.\n\nAt 7 minutes, Rakib is heard further saying that he is disappointed by such a minor attack and that he had come prepared to give his life. He mockingly says that the people of Gopalganj could not do anything to them. At this time Shahidul Islam is heard giving updates on the incident over the phone to someone from army intelligence.\n\nLater, as the convoy moved forward, at every junction/marketplace the sound of indiscriminate firing from army APCs could be heard. Whenever someone outside might have been hit by those shots, everyone inside the car could be heard cheering. They discussed how from the next day arrangements would be made to burn down the houses of the people of Gopalganj.\n\nAt 13 minutes 20 seconds, again the sound of gunfire is heard and from their conversation it seems a motorcyclist was shot and fell down; they rejoice, saying:\n\n“Direct hit!”\n\nAt 19 minutes 30 seconds, the person in the front seat of the car calls a friend in Dhaka and says:\n\n“I will not leave a single trace of Gopalganj’s Awami League in Dhaka city. Wherever I find them, I will slaughter them. Keep yourself ready. Keep 80 AK‑47s ready. We will carry out combing operations across Dhaka city.”\n\nBetween 16–21 minutes, they are heard badmouthing their Home Affairs adviser as well as the IGP, police administration, and BGB, and expressing anger over why they were given only one APC instead of a dozen. They are also furious as to why helicopters were not brought in to open fire.\n\nAt 28 minutes, Shahidul is heard saying that since they are now in politics, they need to keep a first aid kit with them, and in the future there will also be arms and bullets. During a discussion about treating wounds from broken glass in the car, someone says before getting out:\n\n“Everyone bandage yourselves. Politics!”\n\nAt 31 minutes 19 seconds, Rakib is heard talking to someone named Tanvir in Dhaka. Tanvir informs that the blockade in Dhaka has been carried out, which makes everyone happy. At one point, Rakib orders:\n\n“Shut down the entire Dhaka city. Find and kill every Awami League member. Bring everyone in. I have spoken with the Chhatra Dal as well as everyone else. Call Shanto’s people. They will also cooperate to the fullest.”\n\n৩২ মিনিটের এই ভিডিওটা প্রশাসনের পূর্ণ সহায়তায় এবং প্রটেকশনে এনসিপি নেতা কর্মীদের জঙ্গি তৎপরতার প্রামান্য দলিল হয়ে থাকবে। এর প্রতিটা কথোপকথনে উঠে এসেছে তারা কি পরিকল্পনা নিয়ে গোপালগঞ্জে এসেছিল এবং তাদের পরবর্তী পরিকল্পনাগুলো কি। পুরো ভিডিওজুড়েই ছিল আওয়ামীলীগ‚ মুজিব ও গোপালগঞ্জ নিয়ে বিষোদগার‚ উষ্কানী‚ নানাবিধ হুমকি ও হত্যা পরিকল্পনা। গাড়ি থেকেই তারা ঢাকায় নির্দেশ পাঠাতে থাকে যেন যাত্রাবাড়ী দনিয়া কলেজের সামনে ঢাকা - চট্টগ্রাম মহাসড়ক অবরোধ করা হয়। পরের বার গোপালগঞ্জ এলে বঙ্গবন্ধুর কবরও উপড়ে ফেলা হবে বলে আলোচনা চলে। তাদের বিভিন্ন জঙ্গি পরিকল্পনা উঠে এসেছে এসব কথোপকথনে কিন্তু সর্বোপরি যেটা পরিষ্কার হয়েছে তা হলো দেশের সর্বোচ্চ পর্যায়ে প্রশাসনিক সহায়তা থেকে শুরু করে সেনাবাহীনি ও আর্মি ইন্টেলিজেন্সের সাথে সমন্বয় করেই তারা সব পরিকল্পনা বাস্তবায়নের করে এবং একই ভাবে ভবিষ্যতেরও সব প্রস্তুতি নেয়া হবে।\n\nভিডিওটির কিছু চুম্বক অংশ নিচে বর্ণনা করা হলো:\n\nভিডিওটি গোপালগঞ্জ থেকে পালানোর সময় এনসিপির গাড়ি বহরের মাঝের একটা গাড়ি থেকে ধারণ করা এবং মূল ধারা ভাষ্যে ছিল এনসিপি মাদারীপুর জেলার তত্বাবধায়ক রকিব হাসান‚ সে ছাড়াও গাড়িতে আরো উপস্থিত ছিল এনসিপির মাদারীপুরের প্রধান সমন্বয়ক শহীদুল ইসলাম সহ মোট ৬ জন।\n\nশুরুর পর পরই গাড়ি বহরটি একটা ব্যারিকেডের সামনে পড়ে এবং পাশ থেকে ৫-৬ জন গোপালগন্জবাসীকে ইট পাটকেল ছুড়তে দেখা যায়। একটা ইট গাড়িটিতে এসে লাগে এবং এক পাশের কাচ ভেঙ্গে যায় (যদিও পরবর্তীতে তারা সেই ইটকে ককটেল বলে চালিয়ে দেয়ার চেষ্টা করে)। সেই সময় গাড়ির মধ্যকার সবাই চেচামেচি করতে থাকে কেন তাদের হয়ে হামলাকারীদের উপর গুলি ছোড়া হচ্ছে না এবং সেনাবাহিনী গুলি না করলে যেন অস্ত্র তাদের হাতে তুলে দেয়া হয়।  \n\n৩ মিনিট ২০ সেকেন্ডের মাথায় সেনাবাহিনী কেন গুলি করছে না সেই প্রসঙ্গে রাকিবকে বলতে শুনা \"এবার তাদের ফুল এক্সেস দেয়া হয়েছে গুলি করার কিন্তু একটা গুলিও তারা করে নাই\"। অর্থাৎ  জানা গেল সেনাবাহিনীকে মানুষ গুলি করে মারার অর্ডার দেয়া ছিল।\n\n৭ মি: রাকিবকে আরো বলতে শুনা যায় যে সামান্য এই হামলায় সে হতাশ এবং সে নাকি জীবন দেয়ার প্রস্তুতি নিয়েই এসেছিল। সে ব্যঙ্গ করে বলতে থাকে যে গোপালগঞ্জবাসী তাদের কিছুই করতে পারেনি। এই সময় শহিদুল ইসলামকে আর্মি ইন্টেলিজেন্সের কারো সাথে ফোনে ঘটনার আপডেট দিতে শুনা যায়।\n\nপরবর্তীতে গাড়ি বহর আবার এগুতে শুরু করলে প্রতিটা মোড়ে/বাজার-জনপদে সেনাবাহিনীর এপিসি থেকে নির্বিচারে গুলিবর্ষণের শব্দ শুনা যায়। সেই গুলিতে বাইরে কেউ হতাহত হলে গাড়িটির ভিতরের সবাইকে উল্লাস করতে শুনা যায়। তারা বলতে থাকে কিভাবে পরদিন থেকে গোপালগঞ্জবাসী সবার বাড়িঘর জ্বালিয়ে দেয়ার ব্যাবস্থা করা হবে। \n\n১৩ মি: ২০ সে: আবার গুলির শব্দ শুনা যায় এবং তাদের কথোপকথন শুনে মনে হয় কোন এক মটরসাইকেল আরোহীকে গুলি করা হয়েছে এবং সে গুলি খেয়ে পড়ে যাওয়ায় তারা উল্লাস প্রকাশ করে বলতে থাকে \"একেবারে নগদ গুলি\"।\n\n১৯ মি: ৩০ সে: গাড়ির সামনের সিটে বসা ব্যাক্তি ঢাকায় কোন বন্ধূকে কল করে এবং বলে \"আমি ঢাকা শহরে গোপালগঞ্জের আওয়ামীলীগের কোন লেস্পেন্সার রাখবো না। যেখানেই পাই জবাই করবো। তুই রেডি রাখ। অস্ত্র AK-47 সহ ৮০ টা রেডি রাখবি। চিরুনি অভিযান করবো ঢাকা শহর থেকে\"।\n\n১৬-২১ মি:  তাদের স্বরাষ্ট্র উপদেষ্টা সহ আইজিপি পুলিশ প্রসাশন ও বিজিবির বিরুদ্ধে বিষোদগার করতে শুনা যায় এবং কেন তাদের মাত্র ১ টি এপিসি দেয়া হলো‚ কেন ১ ডজন দেয়া হলো না সে বিষয়ে তারা ঊষ্মা প্রকাশ করে। হেলিকপ্টার এনে কেন গুলি করা হলো না তা নিয়েও তারা ক্ষুব্ধ।\n\n২৮ মি: শহীদুলকে বলতে শুনা যায় যে রাজনীতিতে যেহেতু তারা নেমেছে ফার্স্ট এইড কিট সাথে রাখতে হয় এবং পরবর্তীতে আর্মস্ ও বুলেটও থাকবে। গাড়ির ভাঙ্গা কাচের আঘাতে ছড়ে যাওয়া হাত পায়ের প্রাথমিক চিকিৎসার প্রসংগে আলাপকালে একজন বলে নামার আগে \"সবাই কিন্তু ব্যান্ডেজ করবেন। পলিটিক্স!\"\n\n৩১ মি: ১৯: রকিবকে ঢাকায় তানভীর নামে কারো সাথে ফোনে কথা বলতে শুনা যায়। তানভীর জানায় ঢাকায় ব্লকেড করা হয়েছে এবং শুনে সবাই খুশি হয়। এক পর্যায়ে রকিব নির্দেশ দেয় \"পুরা ঢাকা শহর অচল করে দিবা। আওয়ামীলীগের যতগুলা আছে সব খুইজা মাইরা ফেল। সবাইরে নিয়া নাও। ছাত্রদল সহ সবার সাথে কথা হইসে আমার। শান্তদেরকে ফোন দাও। ওরাও সর্বোচ্চ কোপরেট করবে।\"\n\n",

But the thing is even though this branch has a college I don’t wanna stay here as this branch doesn’t have statistics (I don’t wanna take biology). The main branch does have it but then commute would be a huge problem. So now I was thinking about going to ACC. My father is really determined about it. Last time they admitted someone with 1207 and this time as we all know the cut marks will be significantly lower, I think I can shoot my try. However, my father will use his connections too. But, will it be worth it? Or should I just stay in VNC (Bashundhara Branch). I’m really confused. Please help a sister out.",

A reflection on recent political shifts. --- 📌 Main Body (মূল লেখা): In the past year, Bangladesh has witnessed significant political turbulence—protests, public outrage, and finally, a historic shift in power. Sheikh Hasina’s long-standi",
        "body": "\n\nIn the past year, Bangladesh has witnessed significant political turbulence—protests, public outrage, and finally, a historic shift in power. Sheikh Hasina’s long-standing government has fallen, and Nobel Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus is now at the center of political discussions once again. But the key question is — have we truly entered a new era, or is it just a reshuffling of familiar faces behind the curtain?\n\nFor decades, Bangladeshi politics has been dominated by two major parties: Awami League and BNP, with both parties accused of corruption, authoritarianism, and reliance on foreign influence—be it from Delhi, Washington, or even Islamabad.\n\nDeclassified cables and diplomatic leaks over the years have revealed that during the 1991 elections, ISI allegedly supported the BNP, while RAW backed the Awami League. In 2001, RAW reportedly supported both parties to keep influence regardless of the winner. Even the 2007 \"1/11\" military-backed caretaker government was not a purely domestic idea. The infamous “Minus Two” formula, intended to remove both Hasina and Khaleda from politics, reportedly came from insiders of their own parties rather than from foreign diplomats or generals.\n\nToday, as Dr. Yunus is perceived to be silently rising with international support, we must ask:\n\nDoes he truly have a new vision for Bangladesh?\n\nWhy hasn't he clearly stated his political agenda?\n\nIs the current transition just another version of elite power retention, backed by diplomatic games and administrative manipulation?\n\n\nLet’s not forget:\n\nIn 1/11, over 430,000 people were arrested.\n\nIn 2024-25, mass arrests have not occurred in the same scale. Is this caution or complicity?\n\nGovernment corruption scandals—like BCS recruitment leaks, police misconduct, or public fund mismanagement—remain unaddressed.\n\n\nFurthermore, the real power lies within the bureaucracy and security apparatus. Political parties may change, but unless the administrative syndicate is cleansed, no government—civilian or technocratic—can function with transparency.\n\nRecent events (e.g., the use of 2,500 bullets in a protest in Jatrabari, but no mass accountability) raise serious concerns:\n\nDo madrasa students or working-class protesters not deserve justice because they lack political clout?\n\nAre we conditioning ourselves to accept selective justice and superficial change?\n\n\nAs citizens, we need to move beyond party loyalty and ask:\n\n&gt; Who benefits when the people keep changing rulers, but never the system?\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n❓Discussion points (for commenters):\n\nIs Dr. Yunus a real alternative or a placeholder for foreign interests?\n\nCan any political force succeed in Bangladesh without military or diplomatic blessings?\n\nIs administrative corruption now stronger than political corruption?\n\nWhat structural reforms are necessary to truly move forward?\n\n\n\n---\n\n🧠 Let’s talk. Agree or disagree, but don't stay silent.\n📣 Bangladesh deserves more than a new face — it deserves a new foundation.\n\n",

I couldn’t finish it the first day I tried—my head started spinning. Today, I gathered the courage to go through it again. This time, I managed. And then I felt—I must write about this extreme brutality. People deserve to know how so many were victims of such heinous killings.\n\nPersonally, I feel that Awami League supporters aren't very emotional. They’re more like tough-hearted people. I’m like that too. But this report... the hellish scenes in it broke me seriously. Those who consider themselves ‘hard-hearted’—I’m sure if they see this report and the attached images, they will be mentally shattered.\n\nLet me come to the report now.\n\nOn page 36, you’ll find the mutilated body of a police officer named Yunus Ali. He was brutally beaten to death in Rangpur on August 6 and then hung upside down from a tree with his face smashed.\n\nOn page 37, you’ll see 15 dead police officers from Enayetpur Police Station in Sirajganj—lying in one room, soaked in blood. The entire room looks like a killing field from 1971.\n\nOn page 38, you’ll see 4-5 dismembered police officers—some lost their hands, some their throats, some their legs... the blows were so deep and sharp that limbs were completely severed from their bodies.\n\nOn page 35, there’s the body of Santosh Das, a police officer from Sunamganj, also killed and hung from a tree.\n\nAnd on page 44... you’ll see 10-15 police officers burned alive inside a police vehicle. The entire vehicle was set on fire. That scene reminded me of chickens burned in a poultry farm. But they were humans... someone’s son, someone’s father, someone’s brother.\n\nMany have seen the two bodies hanging from the Jatrabari flyover. But that’s just one image. Throughout the report, there are hundreds of such pictures and accounts—you won’t be able to sleep after seeing them.\n\nWho’s responsible for such atrocities? According to the Crisis Research Center, members of BNP, Jubo Dal, Chhatra Dal, Shibir, and various militant groups were involved in these horrific killings.\n\nAccording to the report, 1,100 police officers were victims of this barbarity. And that was just focused on the police.\n\nFrom August 5—the day the Awami League government was overthrown—a new terrifying chapter began. That very night, a mass killing spree of Awami League leaders and workers commenced.\n\nIt began with the brutal beating and hacking to death of Selim Chairman from Chandpur and his son, actor Shanto. In just one night, around a thousand leaders and activists were beaten, hacked, and hung from trees. Most of them were local union council members and grassroots leaders.\n\nOver the next ten months, thousands more were beaten to death by mobs—and it’s still happening. Yet, after all this brutality, the twisted minds responsible for the July militant attacks dare to ask: Where is the remorse from the League? Why doesn’t the League apologize? These medieval-minded, morally bankrupt creatures, now wearing a mask of morality, try to lecture us on civilization!\n\nAnyone who reads this report from beginning to end will understand—BNP, Jamaat, Yunus, and their militant forces can stoop to the lowest depths for power and become unimaginably brutal.\n\n(If you want to read the full report, check the comments.

        "title": "News from the 'Shaheed Gazette' of the July – The Sacrifice of the \"Martyrs\" – Part 1,",
        "body": "# News from the 'Shaheed Gazette' of the July Conspiracy – The Sacrifice of the \"Martyrs\" – Part 1\n\nOn August 5th around 12 PM, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued a notification to all media stating that the Army Chief would deliver a speech to the nation at 2 PM. This announcement was immediately broadcast across all media outlets as “breaking news,” reinforcing the widespread belief that a change in power was imminent—and indeed, that’s what happened.\n\nAs a result, even before the Army Chief's speech that noon, a wave of widespread violence erupted simultaneously across the country: attacks, vandalism, looting, arson, killings, and every form of chaos and lawlessness. From the grassroots union level to Ganabhaban and Parliament House—everywhere witnessed massive destruction, often framed as “mob pressure” or “popular uprising,” which continues to this day.\n\nFollowing August 5th, all groups involved in this so-called movement claimed that the Awami League government carried out a mass killing using security forces and party activists to suppress the protests in July and August. Initially, it was claimed that 4,000 students and civilians were killed. This number was later reduced to 3,000, then again lowered to 2,000 as they failed to provide credible evidence.\n\nLater, a UN inquiry—although criticized as biased—also failed to verify the claim of 2,000 \"martyrs.\" Their report stated that the total number of deaths between July 1st and August 15th could be around **1,400**, which **included ruling party activists, police, BGB, Ansar, and other law enforcement members**.\n\nSince then, the July rioters have stuck to claiming 1,400 deaths, but their own affiliated websites list only “650+ martyrs”!  \nFinally, the **official government 'Shaheed Gazette'** published on **January 15** listed **834 names**.\n\nEven this gazette seems riddled with serious inconsistencies:  \nNo death dates, locations, or causes are mentioned. Many entries lack full addresses, ages, and professions. Common name spellings are intentionally distorted. The list isn’t organized by date, region, or district—making it virtually impossible to verify any entry.\n\nThe occupying government appears to have inflated the number of “martyrs” by including people who died **after** August 5th, who had **no connection** to the movement, and who died from **natural causes or unrelated incidents.**\n\nHere are some of the more absurd entries in this so-called martyr list:\n\n**Entry #28: “Shaheed” Bijoy**  \nDied on **August 13** in a motorcycle accident in Jatrabari while going to buy paratha from a restaurant.  \n\n\n**Entry #37: “Shaheed” Nizam Uddin**  \nKilled on **August 5** during a **violent attack** on Chittagong Central Jail. He was shot by security forces while attempting a riot-led prison break.  \n\n\n**Entry #187: “Shaheed” Javed**  \nAn accused in theft and mugging cases, he had been in jail for three months. On **August 6**, he and others attempted to break out of **Dhaka Central Jail** and attacked guards. Javed died later from injuries.  \n\n\n**Entry #325: “Shaheed” Rakibul Hasan Rocky**  \nDied from **electrocution** while trying to hang a national flag on a bamboo stick during a protest. Death confirmed as electric shock in all official documents.  \n\n\n**Entry #375: “Shaheed” Jinnah Mia**  \nAn accused in the **Holey Artisan attack**, was killed during an attempted escape from **Kashimpur High-Security Jail** on **August 6**.  \n\n\n**Entry #489: “Shaheed” Mamun Ahmed Rafsan**  \nA hotel worker in Cumilla, joined a protest and went live on Facebook. He was later found unconscious and brought dead to hospital. **No signs of injury or bleeding**, suspected heatstroke or heart attack.  \n  \n👉 10 months later, a **murder case was filed**, claiming he was shot.  \n\n\n**Entry #498: “Shaheed” Jamaat activist Shomes Uddin**  \nDied of a **heart attack** while fleeing police who had come to arrest another Jamaat leader. No autopsy or case report was filed.  \n\n\n**Entry #768: “Shaheed” Kawsar Mahmud**  \nWas suffering from **end-stage chronic kidney disease** since long before the protests. Hospital records show no physical injury. Entered hospital **16 days after August 5**, claiming previous police assault with no proof.  \n\n\n**Entry #776: “Shaheed” Al Amin Bhuiyan**  \nKilled on **August 14**, eight days after the power shift, in a **family dispute** over an apartment.  \n👉 [Source](https://www.jugantor.com/tp-news/838161)\n\n**Entry #784: “Shaheed” Imtiaz Hossain Riaz**  \nTook part in an attack on Chhagalnaiya police station. Fled with a looted weapon, which accidentally discharged and injured him. Died later from blood loss.  \n👉 [Attack News](https://www.dhakapost.com/country/309462)  \n👉 9 months later, father (a BNP leader) filed a **murder case** against 57 Awami League activists.  \n👉 [Case News](https://www.dhakapost.com/country/367508)\n\n**Now you tell me:**\n\nHow can those who died from **heart attacks**, **heatstroke**, **road accidents**, or **mob lynching**, or while committing **criminal acts**, be labeled “martyrs of the movement”?\n\nHow did people who died **a week after** the Prime Minister had left the country make it into a “Shaheed Gazette”?\n\nWhat was the intention behind artificially **inflating the martyr list** by adding such unrelated names?\n\n⚠️ **Stay tuned for Part 2** of this exposé, which will feature more shocking details from the so-called **Shaheed Gazette**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lz6gv72bo7af1.jpg?width=999&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0c7cf6ddf2e4eef0367678c45f41b77e205c979\n\n",

        "body": "Yesterday marked a milestone in the growing divide between the left and right, the release of Azher provoking the same type of response that fueled the Shahbag movement in 2013. Right wing activists are seeing this as a massive win, probably the first milestone in post Hasina Bangladesh that marks the downfall of liberalism, while the left finds the event as the beginning of erasing 1971 from our national spirit.\n\nOne thing is clear by now- judiciary was corrupt during the previous regime. There are numerous examples of forced testimonies against alleged war criminals. The waters have been muddied so much that at this point, nothing can solidly convince a rational person.\n\nYet the right is trying to say that the judiciary is perfect now. How can we claim that? Can we really say that the state went through major reforms after 5 August? Every day we hear news about political parties influencing the system, yet we are to believe that the judicial system is above corruption now.\n\nThere is nothing we can do now, another Shahbag can't be formed without state support, nor that it should form. But remember the fact that justice couldn't be ensured due to technicalities.",

At last, the July Movement has returned to those to whom it originally belonged.\n\nThere is no longer any diversity—no girls in T-shirts, no girls in saris, no Shahbagh participants, no progressive liberals of differing opinions or religions. This is exactly how the July Movement was meant to be: a properly defined and uniform movement.\n\nAlthough earlier versions of the movement were diverse in color and ideology, the current one is a purely male-led (\"all-male\") campaign—except for the token presence of a girl from the NCP (Nationalist Conservative Party). The restrictions previously imposed on female participants have now been lifted. During the movement, the NCP presents itself as progressive, only to revert to reactionary stances once the movement concludes—an old and familiar strategy of theirs.\n\nRegardless, what began as an anti-discrimination student movement has, over time, morphed into an anti-Awami League campaign, which now closely resembles a movement led by the madrasa-based factions of Jatrabari. This is now a properly right-wing movement, with participants ranging from Hasanat Abdullah to pro-Khilafat forces like Asif Adnan—many of whom may view the traditional Bengali woman as little more than a mere object of immorality.\n\nIf they manage to achieve their demands today, it would mark a game-changing moment in the political history of this country. It would signal that groups like Hefazat, backed by their mass following, could impose any inhumane or regressive demand, with tacit approval from figures like Hasanat Abdullah.\n\n[Source](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1EhUkqTZaf/)",

Being an outsider, Dhaka is even more difficult to settle in. \n\nI know it sounds very silly but those of you who are in similar shoes, how do you enjoy your life outside the job? where do you go? What do you do? I live in Bashundhara RA now and I often feel like I am living in a secluded island with nowhere to go and nothing to do. \n\nPS: I am a fan of good movies, series, old school music, books, and I enjoy discussing politics, history, literature.

Last night a lot of my family members were invited for the celebration of my parents' 25th anniversary, and due to me being an admission candidate, the talk about what I was preparing for came up. I said I am prepping for DU B and C and their face went pale as I said something so blasphemous that their comprehension cannot imagine. Their first question was. \"you read science your entire life and passed HSC with great grades; why are you going for commerce or arts? Why are you not prepping for buet?\" and in response I said that I want to stay at BD, and the current engineering market is very bad, and I don't want to study in a discipline that has so little potential here at bd. and their response was there is a huge market for engineering at BD, and then they proceeded to say the most hilarious thing i have heard in a while. They said, \"Desher CSE er to onek demand.\" I just wanted to laugh so hard. As I didn't want to argue with them, I said that \"mama, amar to eto brain nai CSE porar\" and left the living room and said to myself how unaware people are when they give any advice. When the potential of CS graduates getting a stable and good-paying job is at an all-time low in the entire world. when tech mammoths are laying off people, there are so many uncles that give this unsolicited advice.

This move is long overdue and honestly exposes a sick legal and cultural loophole in our system.\n\nFor years, rape cases in Bangladesh have been “resolved” through forced compromise marriages basically pressuring the survivor to marry her rapist so the criminal can walk free. This isn’t justice. It’s legalized coercion disguised as “honor” and “settlement.”\n\n**Marriage is not a defense to rape**. A crime doesn’t disappear with a wedding ring. These so-called “compromise marriages” don’t protect survivors but protect rapists. They are driven by social pressure, intimidation, community shaming, and legal manipulation. To make things worse, parts of the media help sanitize these crimes by packaging them as emotional “reunion stories” and feeding people romanticized headlines that hide the violence behind them. It’s manipulation disguised as morality.\n\n**Take a recent example:** singer [Mainul Ahsan Noble literally got married](https://en.prothomalo.com/entertainment/music/bya7ljm0c4) at the gate of Keraniganj Central Jail to the woman who accused him of rape. Yes, a jail gate wedding — while the case is still ongoing — and it was done with court permission. Instead of questioning how a rape accused managed to turn a criminal case into a marital circus, media outlets covered it like some dramatic love story comeback. There was no conversation about accountability, coercion, or power imbalance. Nothing. Just soft-focus headlines and staged smiles.\n\n**And let’s be clear:** this isn’t an isolated case. This happens regularly in Bangladesh, often pushed by local arbitration panels (salish), desperate families, police “settlements,” village elders, or community pressure. It’s not justice, it’s a cultural shortcut used to erase crimes and silence survivors. It is institutionalized victim-blaming, and it has no place in any society that claims to believe in the rule of law or human rights.",

        "body": "Dear users of r/bangladesh,\n\nThere has been a major incident at BUET recently, where a student was arrested following protests at the institute over allegations of sexual misconduct &amp; assault based on comments made on a Reddit account. If you have missed the incident, you can read more on it [here](https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/buet-student-arrested-under-cyber-security-law-4016031).\n\nIn regard to the incident, there have been rising allegations of the involvement of the accused with our subreddit. While it is true that the Reddit account in question had engagement on r/bangladesh, none of that had any form of sexual or suggestive content as has been highlighted. The original allegation was made via a Facebook post, with detailed screenshots highlighting various interactions of the user on Reddit. You can have a look at the [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/share/17UwfzLuTa/?mibextid=wwXIfr) to see the user’s confession of sexual assault has nothing to do with our subreddit.\n\nWith that in mind, we urge you to stay vigilant during these times, not just to protect those that may be or may become victims of sexual assault, but also to protect those who maybe unjustly accused of doing so. To be clear, we are 100% opposed to the  targeting of Hindus on a religious basis and linking them to the allegations of misconduct by the accused. Sexual violence knows no religion, and has historically been caused in our nation by people of various backgrounds. This also does not give free rein to target other religions either.\n\nThe Reddit user in question specifically targeted Muslim individuals, but that could have been to anyone for any reason, and is in no shape or form an indicator of what most Hindus would support. At the end of the day, this is a safe space for all Bangladeshis of all backgrounds. All we ask from you is to respect that tolerance for all subreddit members, which is not just an expectation from our moderator team but also from the Reddit administrators themselves.\n\n\\- r/bangladesh Moderator Team",

Doing whataboutism by bringing Madrasa incidents, defending this individual, asking people to be careful (I get it, but hello? Not the right time maybe??). What the actual fook again? Why is it so hard to call a spade a spade?\n\n4. Hindus are people. Just like how Muslims are people. Applies for all religions. There are good and bad. Why are people so polarized and hateful that they keep on generalizing and spread hate towards an entire group on a broad spectrum? Really? What's wrong with you all?\n\n5. That being said, the majority/minority dynamics is real and also exists. It does not undermine the struggles the minorities face in our country. It seems like some people are attempting to undermine it with this incident. Despicable mentality. Also thanks to the one who wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chekulars/comments/1ocqs7d/%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%9F_%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%A4_%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AF/).\n\n6. Not going to defend this individual but doxxing and mob mentality can be very dangerous. I am pretty sure they got the correct person in this case, but this also sets a dangerous precedent. How do we know the individual who wrote the disgusting comments and confessions is the one who was identified as such in real life? Nice detective work you say. Well, what's to stop me from framing someone like this tomorrow by posting anonymous random clues for someone to find? Why can't people see that? This is why there needs  to be a thorough investigation and justice needs to be served methodically.\n\n7. No, [it is not all quiet](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1ockumd/all_quiet_on_rbangladesh/) on r/bangladesh. Kinda ironic how people [against our national anthem](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1kl0gm2/comment/ms0ue91/?context=3&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) are saying it though. People have things to do and not everyone is always available to write posts and comments about every issue. Sometimes I don't find time to reply to comments for days. I was about to sleep and reading some of the comments made me so angry that it compelled me to get up and write this. Awful generalization of the sub even when this accused individual wrote most of his revolting comments in some other subs. There are many amazing Redditors active in this sub and this sub has a great environment overall. I would like for it to be in this way, which is why I am hating all these irrational and awful hatred and polarization. Get a grip people.\n\n8. Lastly, the individual who can write such posts is truly a horrible being and a disturbed person. They should face consequences for the heinous crimes and harassment they did, but it must be delivered by following a due process. This is not a kink nor a personal choice, it's a horrendous crime.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7az4lceyckwf1.png?width=718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10abb06f87469d09eeab4db63ad22e715761ac28",

        "title": "Why is it so hard to find sincerity in today’s marriage market?",
        "body": "I have been going through the arranged marriage process for a while now. Honestly, I am exhausted. It feels less like a search for companionship and more like a never-ending interview I never signed up for.\n\nYou grow up thinking that being kind, educated, respectful, and family-oriented will be enough, but apparently, there’s always a new checklist waiting.\n\nEvery family seems to have its own version of “ideal,” which is fine. I believe outlook in life, family values, traditions, religious principles, and family background matter to some extent. But marriage itself needs compatibilities like emotional understanding, patience, communication, and mutual respect. Yet people seem to have such a detailed picture in their heads that no real human could ever match.\n\nA man in his late thirties or forties can confidently ask for a bride in her early twenties, and everyone nods like it’s the most natural thing. But once a woman crosses thirty, suddenly it’s “meyer to boyosh hoye gese,” as if her worth came with an expiry date.\n\nWhy isn’t emotional maturity one of the most important things in marriage? I know for a fact I wasn’t mature enough to handle marriage at twenty-five. Life since then has taught me patience, empathy, and how to actually communicate. Shouldn’t that be seen as an asset? Personally, I’d prefer a partner who’s emotionally mature too. Someone who knows marriage is built on understanding, not control.\n\nOne family I met kept asking whether I had applied for a teaching position at any university. Their son apparently had to marry a university teacher because, in their words, “amader ghorer bou meyera deshi bideshi university te job kore.” When I said no, they rejected me of course. The irony? Two months later, I landed that exact position, the same coveted academic job they used to dismiss me.\n\nThen came another gem. One guy said, “Meye to dekhte thikthak, ototao kharap na.” Honestly, if I had to reply in the same tone, I could’ve said, “Chele ototao short na, bhuri o khub beshi boro na, mukh vorti pimple o temon beshi na.” But of course, that would be “impolite.” Apparently, judgment is a one-way street.\n\nThen there was also the “perfect” proposal, a BUET graduate! His family was described as religious; both parents were Haji. On paper, it looked flawless. Within minutes, though, the real picture came.\n\nThe guy literally said, “Maa jaa bole, shetai.” Well, what a good baccha they raised! Respecting parents is beautiful, but marriage requires independent thought and emotional maturity. If you can’t make your own decisions, how are you going to handle the responsibility of being a husband? Ask your mother? Why does it have to be a choice between your parents and your spouse? Both relationships deserve love and respect. Marriage is about balance, not competition.\n\nAnyway, that’s not even the worst part. The worst part was that his mother asked me to remove my scarf in front of everyone “just to see how I look with my hair.” These were people who wanted a “pious girl,” yet had no issue asking her to compromise her values for their curiosity. And as if that wasn’t enough, she looked me up and down, even leaned under the table to check my feet. It felt like I was a showpiece on display, being inspected rather than met. It was humiliating.\n\nDespite all my hard work, my years of education, my achievements, and my character, none of it seemed to matter. Compared to his “BUET” degree, my accomplishments meant nothing. If I had been a man with my exact profile, people would probably call me “highly accomplished” and “a great match.” But because I’m a woman, the same accomplishments have somehow turned into flaws — “too high-profile,” “intimidating,” or “a liability.” They wanted a bride who was religious and educated, just not too much of either.\n\nAnd now, there’s a new kind of checklist. Because I’m living abroad, many proposals aren’t about compatibility or character anymore, it’s about convenience. Someone literally called my father and said, “Amar cheler America jawar onek shokh.” So now, apparently, I’m not just a prospective bride, I’m a potential visa.\n\nHow exactly are you supposed to satisfy all these shifting requirements? The right age, the right job, the right look, the right location and still be seen as a person? The process feels less about finding compatibility and more about ticking boxes.\n\nMarriage is supposed to be about shared responsibility, trust, and emotional respect, but in this market, those words have turned into slogans. Everyone says them; few actually mean them.\n\nMaybe someday people will start seeing marriage for what it’s meant to be: a sincere partnership between two people who genuinely understand and respect each other.\n\nUntil then, I’ll keep believing that Allah’s plan will lead me to the right person, not the perfect résumé.",

Likewise, its not a pure theoretical discussion of the ideologies of existing political parties but simply trying to explore why Jamaat is so popular among people, especially youths. So, for the time being I'd like to put aside other parties and stick to two most popular parties - Jamaat and NCP. \n\nBecause, honestly speaking, I have met some Gen-Z who support Jamaat, yet seldom met any person who supports NCP. Even among the most liberal and left-leaning people, I have yet not found any support for NCP. I think it is true in almost all places, where you'd find many Gen-Z supporting Jamaat, but very few supporting NCP, even if they *don't support anything*.\n\nThe primary reason for this is, how the coordinators downplayed the revolution of common people and ordinary students. Truth be told, common people went for revolution mainly because of poor living condition stemming from things like \"price hike\". While, ordinary students protested because they saw DU and other important public university students protesting and getting closer towards a revolution's end. \n\nIts undeniable that, DU led the protest and initiated everything, but after a certain point, both non-popular public universities and private universities along with college students went to protest and kept protesting for a long time. Maybe they did not have much organized political councils in them, but every stuck to \"Amra sobai Somonnayak\" slogan.\n\nBut, right after the revolution, the great schism of public and private university begins. Private university students felt they were neglected by the same people they protested for a long time. College (high-school) students may easily ignore it, but private uni students could not bear up with the feeling of resentment.\n\nAnd the more you progress, you see, there hasn't been much of a reformation in the past 1 year. Only reformation that was done was to establish a political party, which nobody was looking for. What ordinary people were looking forward to and the promises being made, none of it was fulfilled. On the other hand, few of the things got worse as many mills and factories had to be shut down. \n\nAnd since, people usually see current government being tied to NCP, they have given up their hope. They are simply looking for an alternative, where only Jamaat stands. ",

        "title": "DUCSU 2025 - Analysis Of Shibir's Landslide Victory And Aftermath",
        "body": "The DUCSU 2025 election took place on 9th September 2025, and the results are out. Shibir's landslide victory in the election surprised most people, and many are still struggling to accept it. This is just my personal analysis and observation of the election. To be frank, I am very much anti-Shibir ideologically, but I do congratulate them on their victory because this is how democracy should work. Perhaps I will garner downvotes from both sides, but putting that aside, here is an attempt to analyze the event and the aftermath objectively.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThis was the first DUCSU election since 2019. Out of approximately 39,775 registered students, an impressive [\\~75%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_DUCSU_election#Vice-President_election) cast their votes. Shibir won by a huge margin in the top three posts - Vice President, General Secretary, and Assistant General Secretary. Out of the remaining 12 posts in the central committee, [Shibir won 9 seats](https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/7shgm6t3ll), and independent candidates won 3 seats. Out of the 15 seats in the central committee, there are 13 more seats. Shibir won in 11 of them, 1 was won by an independent candidate, and the other by a leftist candidate.\n\n[https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/2025\\_DUCSU\\_election#Vice-President\\_election](https://preview.redd.it/8dp92i0doeof1.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=662a72bb59b9d70e00946f92c0931b44c7b8d3c7)\n\nInitially, many candidates like [Abid](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/ddaaksu-nirbaacn-kaarcupir-abhiyog-aabidsh-dui-praarthiir) from Chatra Dal, [Umama](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/yr9ll5lv3u), Meghmallar, and [Abdul Kader](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/798953r10n), called the election a fraud and denounced it. It should be noted that there were indeed several issues, discrepancies, and mishaps during the election. But it seems these were in the minority, and it is [unlikely to have impacted the election results significantly](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/jtegu85p55). It is [not rational](https://www.facebook.com/kallol.mustafa/posts/pfbid0BhqJRAfxujZ42gZbM7pXvCdakaD79z66ciw1dga2sPTTfaWfrT8wA7UycX9L6paml) to make claims of election engineering without strong evidence. However, controversies in JUCSU and [such claims](https://www.facebook.com/kazijesinbd/posts/pfbid035hT9mSugPNNK7rDh9yfQjdFn5b3Q1v8SEgAYrrzmxYwP5Wj3UqTQm1LswemrJtQbl) do have some merit and perhaps we should also attempt to find out the answer to [these questions](https://www.facebook.com/meghmallar.bosu/posts/pfbid02tv7bpyJAYRWTJRp2znJNh9iM9ycFLU51ZzFzTCKSyfRpK12An8HthGEnQif964Yrl).\n\nBut it seems likely that it was a fair election which Shibir won. This leads us to the next point - understanding how that outcome came about. As I said, I am ideologically strongly anti-Shibir, but to counter their ideology, we need to understand the problem and how it happened first. Below, I outline and rank these factors in order of importance.\n\n**Clean Positive Image, Welfare-based Politics, And Humility**\n\nAs surprising as it might sound, this seems to be the [biggest reason](https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/g9wby5oaqm) to me. The Shibir candidates have a strong positive image on campus. Shadik Kayem, who became the VP, is also one of the leaders of the July Movement. Shibir also actively did welfare-based politics - helped poor students, organized career training and programs, various social welfare, and [innovative ideas](https://www.facebook.com/saerzulkarnain/posts/pfbid0Yeo87r6h2Fh2eTgbsX69ww1hUptMSsdvmo9F8MwqBthZb78VLK5YdniysPCraK6yl). Chatra Dal and the leftist organizations fall behind significantly on these aspects, at least when considering scale and dedication.\n\nShibir were humble and genuine throughout the campaign and even [after victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMmbVbQaDFA). People do not like arrogance and attitude, especially after a mass uprising. You can question their intent and ideology all you want, but there is no doubt that this is the perception they were able to create with their actions.\n\n**Frustration With Other Political Parties And Weak Opposition**\n\nChatra Dal is stupid, frankly speaking, and does not have their priorities right. It is quite easy to see through their superficial acts and rhetoric. NCP is very controversial, divided, and arrogant. If NCP were not so controversial and divided, it could have participated in the election united and also would have garnered tons of votes from the swing voters. The independent candidates were good, which is why they won 5 seats and got many votes, but they also don't have the political strength and backing. Therefore, many students were unsure and could not rely on their promises and how much they would be able to deliver, despite their goodwill.\n\nAs for the leftists, it's a bit different. When there is an injustice, leftist organizations are usually the first to take a stand against it, and this is great. But what about the common daily struggles of the students? Imagine a poor student outside of Dhaka struggling. He/she finds solace when Shibir bonds with them, shares spiritual stuff, helps them with career development, provides food, etc. What do the leftist parties do? Leftist parties mean well and promise changes, but in practice, they fall short in terms of delivering them to the common students via structured campaigns and activities. Left-aligned individuals are nice and often help others, but this gets associated mostly on a personal level and not with an ideology/party. Whereas in the case of Shibir, the party benefits because of its structure and strategy. The leftist parties do have their limitations despite good intentions. For example, they do not have much funding. On the other hand, Shibir is very organized and has access to large funds from various sources.\n\n**Organization Structure And Campaign Strategy**\n\nShibir is methodical, organized, united by a common ideology, and recruits/grooms meritorious students from an early age. They have been preparing for DUCSU for more than a year. Their door-to-door campaign and interaction with students were nothing short of remarkable. While others were busy playing checkers, they played chess. It's a long-term game, and they were very focused on their goals and pursued them methodically.\n\n**Social Acceptance**\n\nThe two biggest criticisms of Shibir are being anti-1971 and being extremists. They [still are](https://www.shibir.org.bd/center/uploaded/CONSTITUTION%20book_Final_2024.pdf) in many ways, but they have managed to convince a large part of their members and supporters, and also the swing voters otherwise. As for 1971, they never disown or condemn the roles of their predecessors but diplomatically pay tribute to the freedom fighters and the liberation war. It is very questionable and ambiguous at best, but combine that with the rise of anti-1971 propaganda (not necessarily from Shibir) and how BAL used, distorted, and sold 1971 to justify their crimes, Shibir succeeded in creating an illusory image that the present generation of Shibir is not anti-1971 and should not have to bear the crimes of their ancestors.\n\nAs for extremism, they have managed to trick others with deception and manipulation. They have many intellectuals like Mirza Ghalib who are not extremists in the traditional sense and often justify their fundamentalism and problematic policies with diplomacy and word salad. With the intellectuals and social media activists, they were able to portray themselves as liberal democrats with a mix of religious/ethical dedication in the eyes of many.\n\n**Vote Splits**\n\nI would have ranked it much higher had Shibir not won by a huge margin. Notice that a significant portion of the people still voted against Shibir. For the [VP post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_DUCSU_election#Vice-President_election), there were four other good candidates, and the votes were split across them.\n\n**Rise Of Fundamentalism**\n\nNo doubt that fundamentalism and right-wing politics have risen in Bangladesh. There are many reasons for this, not diving deep here for now. It is important to note that many Islamic parties and right-wing individuals are strongly against Shibir. But nonetheless, a significant part sympathizes with Shibir. And due to their somewhat aligned goals and hatred for liberal democracy and leftists, it is likely they voted for Shibir.\n\n**Victimhood**\n\nShibir was oppressed by BAL for years. BAL also normalized attacking or even killing people by tagging them as \"Shibir\". For example, the murder of Abrar Fahad. It didn't matter if they did Shibir or not. When you oppress a group like this, you end up making them victims and martyrs. And naturally, people sympathize with them.\n\n**Liberal Hypocrisy And Elitism**\n\nWhen liberals remain silent as Hefazot is massacred in Shapla in 2013, when liberals blockade Shahbagh for weeks, and instead of demanding a fair and impartial trial, deliver the sentence themselves while chanting hateful and violent slogans, when liberals enable BAL's atrocities just because they believe there is a greater evil. When some liberals resort to [hateful acts](https://www.facebook.com/faisalxahmed01/posts/pfbid02QtrDVdh4hxxowJNNBJZ4MKp6NGRSY5q75FBw3EcdGaGT5S87ARd32dNN5kUS2ge2l), and the others are silent (is it much different from some fundamentalists doing hateful acts and moderates staying silent?). Do all these create a positive or negative branding about their values and ideologies? Heck, it does not matter how correct your ideologies or values are if your actions are like this.\n\nIs there a difference between \"kanke mage hejab koi???\" and \"Look at those brainless Hijabi KFC chickens simping over Shibir\"? Is the difference a matter of ideology or mentality? Hatred only brews more hatred, and before you know it, you end up becoming the monster you started to fight yourself. There is a difference between being strong and being a bigot. You could strongly make the point why you think the Hijab is a symbol of modesty and should be preferred, but not imposed. Or you could strongly make the point why you believe that the Hijab is a symbol of oppression due to how it is enforced and how women are conditioned. Instead of doing that, what are you achieving with hate? Do you want to see the world burning, or do you want to influence and change others to follow your values? Even if you are right rationally, what does it tell others about your values if your actions are hateful? Will you influence others or push them away?\n\nAnd no, it is not being diplomatic or always taking a non-binary stance. Some things **are binary**. If someone is against democracy, against human rights, you don't excuse that by taking a non-binary position. You stand against them firmly and fight it. You just don't have to become like them in the process.\n\nAll these things act like slow poisoning. It pushes people away. If a swing voter were considering voting for you, they would be repelled, and then they must choose between the lesser evil. Perhaps they agree with you on how the other side is so bad, but you pissed them off so bad with your elitism and hypocrisy that they would rather vote for the bad guys than you. This is literally [one of the biggest reasons](https://www.paulgraham.com/woke.html) why someone like Trump is in power in the US.\n\n# If Shibir Is So Good, Why Don't You...\n\nThat's a lovely question. Dr Zahed explains it much better than I can ever [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c113p8ewMUw). I also shared my reasoning earlier [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1nauanz/%E0%A6%A1%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B8_%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%AC_%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AF_%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%9A%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%9B%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%B0_%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95_%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%9F_%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%AF_%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%A3/). Shibir's politics is [identity politics](https://annas-archive.org/md5/15a5c6b4cc7c7b0ab75c99c9a3ae29c0), which always excludes instead of including everyone. BJP and Hindutva, Trump's white supremacism, Israel's Zionism, Jamaat's Islamism are all the same. History teaches us that nothing good ever comes out of it, no matter how charming they might seem initially.\n\nThey have the following in their constitution. They leave it purposefully vague so that when someone confronts them and questions how their goals are anti-democratic, they can twist their argument with word salad and mental gymnastics and argue how it's not. But one only has to look at the mainstream interpretations and wonder why they have so many details in their booklets, but they never specify how exactly democracy and democratic values will work in their system. They never clarify their interpretation of the religion and how they will use it to rule the country. It's bits and pieces to lure people with deception and manipulate them to gain their support. Hypocrisy and ambiguity everywhere, the perfect example of a wolf in sheep's clothing.\n\n\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.shibir.org.bd\\/center\\/uploaded\\/CONSTITUTION&amp;#37;20book\\_Final\\_2024.pdf \\(Page 10\\)](https://preview.redd.it/a1cspuwavlof1.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a964bf51858b76c154b673df74ffcd08d1e606)\n\nThey are against democracy, [against equal rights of men and women](https://youtu.be/LVONB0hdr0o?t=2710), and many universally accepted human rights. They seek to impose their perceived version of an Islamic Sharia, even though [most Islamic parties strongly oppose Jamaat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioXBubjsSao) in terms of ideology. They are a political party in a democratic system that seeks to come to power with democracy and trickery, and when they do come to power, they will destroy the very same democratic values themselves.\n\nJamaat supporters and sympathizers, does it sound absurd to some? Or is that what you want as well? Are you an extremist or just brainwashed? Don't believe me? Well, it's right in their damn [booklets](https://www.shibir.org.bd/center/uploaded/kormo_proddhoti.pdf) and [constitution](https://www.shibir.org.bd/center/uploaded/CONSTITUTION%20book_Final_2024.pdf). It's a dangerous philosophy and a recipe for disaster.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nWhile this won't significantly impact the upcoming election, it is likely to have a long-term domino effect and end up in one of two ways. While the BNP still appears likely to win the upcoming election, the contest will be far more competitive than many expected. In the longer term, however, the real test will be whether the leftists, liberals, and centrists can reform and rebuild their politics. BNP will also need to do the same. If this possibility happens, then there is a silver lining, and we have a chance.\n\nThe other possibility, which is also more likely, is that nobody learns anything, and this begins the first step towards us moving backwards. Right-wing parties and fundamentalist groups could re-emerge with renewed confidence. gaining political traction. Moral policing and harassment will increase. Over time, this trajectory could pave the way for a party like Jamaat to ascend to power. It wouldn’t necessarily mirror Afghanistan, but the state of human rights, especially for women and minorities, would deteriorate sharply. Economic growth would be stunted, international relations and trade would suffer, and the country could spiral toward anarchy, civil conflict, or even foreign intervention.\n\nThe fundamentalists and extremists are already delighted by this result, and they did not wait for long to start the shitshow - [Example 1](https://www.facebook.com/Anik0000/posts/pfbid02KyNgH6THnmgCHwozXBnwW49GEYCC1UaWnkr1dsdbd9WnsEsA9TF4VVSkboHXVUwBl), [Example 2](https://www.facebook.com/Anik0000/posts/pfbid02ur4gw68qA89dv5mdcM8WvxCjjMAMqSJCZPedvXatYGvw11FEGP5TM8tAZjpKjo6nl), [Example 3](https://www.facebook.com/arunimatahsin/posts/pfbid0ZRuAenSiH48G8UbUCNfCx67x6vxVPQfps2z5wrUSfvwKmGoTwCBcg7ptxQbHXBL6l), [Example 4](https://www.facebook.com/Anik0000/posts/pfbid02aCg9ZtdFKNcxNGFGYKzLsuit5advcCeJnPm2pPNnm4ej941ZjhJnbcWwNsuvnwpLl), [Example 5](https://www.facebook.com/parvezalambd/posts/pfbid02KcjVVZAnVGNDyoASjaLKAUcQhh3Eo3mcsKzuga6JmJ9d7daJcyVZsc9ko8Cb5DaUl). The rest will follow eventually.\n\nTo the voters who voted for Shibir - knowingly or unknowingly, you guys set the ball in motion. Either we will get a better r/bangladesh, or r/LeopardsAteMyFace is our future. Let's see what the future awaits.",

        "body": "\"The DUCSU results cannot be explained only by ideology or alleged rigging. The real reasons lie in Shibir's long-term groundwork, soft communication, symbolic candidates, disciplined polling management, and reaching out to female and non-residential students.\n\nMeanwhile, JCD, Bangladesh Ganatantrik Chhatra Sangsad, leftist groups, and independents entered late, stayed divided, relied on heavy political language, and failed to connect with ordinary students.\n\nThe lesson is clear: in today's Dhaka University, organisation, perception, and communication style matter more than old political slogans. Shibir understood this reality, and that is why they won.\"",

একই যুক্তি কি এখানেও খাটে না? অতীতের দায়মোচন না করে যারা সামনে আগাতে চায়, তাদের ভরসা করা কতটুকু যৌক্তিক আর নৈতিক?\n\nআচ্ছা, এবার মুক্তিযুদ্ধ বাদ দিলাম। অন্য প্রসঙ্গে বলি। ইসলামী ছাত্রশিবির নিজেদেরকে একটি ইসলামী আদর্শভিত্তিক ছাত্রসংগঠন দাবি করলেও তাদের কার্যক্রমের মধ্য দিয়ে প্রায়ই চরমপন্থী ও উগ্র রাজনৈতিক প্রবণতা স্পষ্ট হয়েছে। সংগঠনটির [ঘোষিত উদ্দেশ্য](https://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/publication/file/185_constitution_Jan_2020.pdf) হচ্ছে ইসলামী সমাজব্যবস্থা প্রতিষ্ঠা করা। এই লক্ষ্য বাংলাদেশের সংবিধানপ্রদত্ত ধর্মনিরপেক্ষ ও গণতান্ত্রিক চরিত্রের সঙ্গে সাংঘর্ষিক। লক্ষ্য অর্জনের জন্য তারা ছাত্র সমাজকে প্রভাবিত করতে চায়। যার জন্য তারা স্কুল থেকেই তাদের কার্যক্রম শুরু করে এবং বিভিন্নভাবে প্রভাব খাটিয়ে কোমলমতি শিক্ষার্থীদের তাদের আদর্শে আনতে চেষ্টা করে, যা কিনা অনৈতিক কারণ এটা অনেকটা মগজধোলাই। এবং তারা এটা করে ধর্মের নামে, যেহেতু তারা ধর্মভিত্তিক পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি করে যা কিনা গণতন্ত্রের জন্য বিপজ্জনক। জামায়াতের আদর্শ মওদুদীবাদের বিপদ সম্পর্কেও [এখান](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBagqYrn9tg) থেকে আরো জেনে নিতে পারেন এবং কেন অনেক ইসলামী দল এবং আলেম এর বিরোধিতা করেন।\n\nধর্মভিত্তিক পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি শুধু সংখ্যালঘু নয়, বাকিদের জন্যও বিপজ্জনক। বিশ্বের বিভিন্ন দেশে দেখা গেছে, যখন ধর্ম বা জাতিগত পরিচয়ের ভিত্তিতে রাজনীতি জোরদার হয়, তখন সহিংসতা ও গৃহদ্বন্দ্ব বেড়ে যায়। যেমন ভারত এবং বিজেপি সরকার এর একটি বড় উদাহরণ। পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি সমাজকে একত্রিত না করে বরং খণ্ডিত করে। আর এখানে যখন ধর্মের বিভিন্ন ব্যাখ্যা আছে, তখন বিষয়টি আরো বিপজ্জনক হয়ে যায় যা কিনা অসহিষ্ণুতা বাড়িয়ে দেয়। যদি উদাহরণ দেই, ধরেন আপনি ধার্মিক এবং হিজাব করেন। আপনি নাও করতে পারেন এবং দুই ক্ষেত্রেই সেটা আপনার ব্যক্তিগত মত এবং অধিকার। তবে ধর্মভিত্তিক এসব দল ক্ষমতায় আসলে আপনার তাদের ব্যাখ্যা এবং মন মতই পর্দা করতে হবে। এই অসহিষ্ণুতা এবং জোর খাটানোর প্রবণতাই সব থেকে বিপজ্জনক।\n\nআর খেয়াল করে দেখবেন যে শিবির ধারাবাহিকভাবে মুনাফেকি রাজনীতি করে। তাদের গঠনতন্ত্রে নারী নেতৃত্ব নিষিদ্ধ, তাদের নারী কর্মীদেরও নেকাব করা বাধ্যতামূলক কিন্তু ডাকসুর প্রার্থী হিসেবে তারা এমন কিছু নারীকে দিয়েছে যাদের জন্য আবার এমনটি প্রযোজ্য নয়। এই দ্বিমুখী আচরণের যৌক্তিক ব্যাখ্যা কি? বিপরীতমুখী হয়ে গেল না? তারা যদি সত্যিই পরিবর্তন আর আধুনিক হত, তবে কি দ্বিমুখী আচরণ করতো? প্রকৃতপক্ষে এটা আসলে ধোঁকা ছাড়া আর কিছুই না। গুপ্ত এবং মুনাফেকি রাজনীতি করবে, সুবিধা নিবে কিন্তু কোন দায় নিবে না। যেমন কয়েকদিন আগে তাদের একজন কর্মী [গণধর্ষণের হুমকি](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/29czmjum2o) দিল, কিন্তু আলোচনায় আসলে গুপ্ত রাজনীতির সুবিধা হিসেবে দল হিসেবে কোন দায়ই নিল না। আর অনলাইনে ধারাবাহিকভাবে নারী হেনস্তা এবং যে কোন সমালোচনার [হেনস্তা](https://www.facebook.com/abdul.qader.790007/posts/pfbid01JSoFFZeUBSiiRCDaCvKZGvvssu3X3C1GjvUHguefgSKwW5gEsHL7ZF9F6fFQ3Yal) তারা করেই যাচ্ছে ক্রমাগত।\n\nআর সবশেষে যে বিষয়ে বলবো তা হচ্ছে শিবির কি বাকি ছাত্র সংঘটনগুলোর থেকে আলাদা? এর উত্তর হচ্ছে হ্যাঁ এবং না দুটোই। শিবিরের আদর্শ এবং গঠনতন্ত্র অনেক আলাদা বাকি সংঘটনগুলোর থেকে। শিবির অনেক বেশি সংগঠিত এবং এরা প্রচুর মেধাবী শিক্ষার্থীও আকৃষ্ট করে। কিন্তু একটা কথা বুঝতে হবে যে মূর্খ শয়তানের থেকে শিক্ষিত শয়তান বেশি খারাপ। শিবিরের অনেক কর্মী এবং নেতা ব্যক্তি হিসেবে ভালো, দেশের ভালোও চায়, কিন্তু যখন দলগত এবং আদর্শগত এত সমস্যা থাকে, তখন সমষ্টিগতভাবে সাধারণত সেটা ভালো কিছু বয়ে আনে না। গত ১৬ বছর তারা লীগ দ্বারা অত্যাচারিত হয়েছে, তাই জেন জির অনেকেই হয়তো শিবিরের ইতিহাস সম্পর্কে জানে না। তখন এখনকার মত সোশ্যাল মিডিয়াও ছিল না তাই এই বিষয়ে তথ্য প্রমাণও কম। তার পরেও পুরনো পত্রিকা এবং সেই সময়কার আলোচকদের সাথে কথা বললে অনেক কিছুই জানবেন। এই বিষয়ে আর বেশি কিছু বলছি না তবে কারো আগ্রহ থাকলে তাসনীম খলিলের [এই](https://www.facebook.com/tasneem.khalil/posts/%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%97-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF-%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%93-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%93%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%87-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9F%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%95/10170443322455319/) পোস্ট, এবং [এই](https://www.facebook.com/tasneem.khalil/posts/%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%97-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8-%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%AB%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%82-%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%95-%E0%A7%A7%E0%A7%AF%E0%A7%AD%E0%A7%A7-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%9B%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%98-%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%80-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9B%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%B9/10170448123495319/) পোস্ট দেখে নিতে পারেন। পোস্টের নিচেও অনেক মন্তব্য আর প্রমাণ আছে। শিবির যেসব ক্যাম্পাসের নিয়ন্ত্রণ পেয়েছিল (যেমন চবি), সেগুলোর সাংস্কৃতিক এবং সবকিছুর পরিবর্তনও একটু ঘাটলেই জানতে পারবেন। সেখানে তাদের নিয়ন্ত্রণ এবং সহিংসতা কেমন ছিল নিয়ন্ত্রণ নেওয়ার পরে একটু জেনে দেখবেন খোঁজ করে। এবং এটা মোটেও শুধু তাদের অতীত চরিত্র নয়, [বর্তমানেও](https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/district/2ybmze1yxc) খুব বেশি পরিবর্তন হয় নাই। এরকম ভাবার কোন যৌক্তিক কারণ নেই যে অন্য দলগুলোর তুলনায় শিবির গেস্টরুম এবং সহিংসতার চর্চায় ভালো কোন নজির স্থাপন করবে।\n\nতাহলে আপনি ছাত্র শিবিরকে কখন এবং কেন ভোট দিবেন? সরলীকরণ করি একটু। নিম্নের যে কোন একটি সত্যি হলে ভোট দিন তাদের।\n\n* আপনি ১৯৭১ এবং মুক্তিযুদ্ধবিরোধী।\n* শহীদদের রক্তের সাথে বেঈমানি করতে আপনার খারাপ লাগে না। কারণ আপনি মনে করেন সেটা ৫০ বছর আগের কথা এবং শিবিরের এখন অনেক পরিবর্তন হয়েছে।\n* আপনি উগ্র ধর্মীয় মতবাদে বিশ্বাসী, অগণতান্ত্রিক পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি পছন্দ করেন, সংখ্যালঘু এবং নারীর অধিকার চান না।\n* আপনি তথাকথিত মূলধারার রাজনীতি নিয়ে চরম বিরক্ত। আপনি পরিবর্তন চান খুব করে। কিন্তু আপনার মাথায় বাস্তবতা নেই এবং এটা বুঝতে চান না যে পরিবর্তন শুধু ভালোর দিকে না, খারাপের দিকেও যেতে পারে। ঢিমেতালে আগালেও গণতান্ত্রিকভাবে দেশ এগিয়েছে এত দিন। আপনি মূলধারার রাজনৈতিক দলগুলোকে মধ্যাঙ্গুলি দেখানোর দিকে এতই মনোযোগী যে সেই বাস্তবতা অথবা ঝুঁকি বোঝার মত ক্ষমতা অথবা ইচ্ছা আপনার কোনটাই নেই। সহজ করে বললে আপনার মনটা ভালোই কিন্তু বোকার স্বর্গে বাস করেন।\n\nতো প্রিয় ছোট ভাই বোনেরা, জেন জি এবং তারুণ্যের নাম আর ডুবাবেন না। আপনারা পড়াশোনা জানা মানুষ, একটু ভাবেন। আর দিন শেষে ভাবনা চিন্তা করে যেটা ভালো মনে হয় করেন। যদি অযৌক্তিক কিছু বলে থাকি সেটা আলোচনা করেন। আর নাহলে এমন কাউকে নির্বাচিত করবেন না যার জন্য আপনার এবং জাতিকেও ভবিষ্যতে খেসারত দিতে হয়।\n\nব্যক্তিগত মত তুলে ধরেছি কিন্তু চেষ্টা করেছি নিরপেক্ষভাবে তথ্য প্রমাণ তুলে ধরেই বলার। ইচ্ছা হলে যে কোন অংশ কপি পেস্ট করে পোস্ট করতে পারেন, ক্রেডিট দেওয়ার দরকার নাই।\n\n",

Why is a degree from places like IBA (DU) or NSU treated like it’s something special, and why do companies give so much preference to those graduates? Is it really about what they learn, or more about the brand name and connections?\n\nWhat confuses me is that I see a lot of people doing either BBA or CSE, yet many of them still end up jobless or working in positions that don’t really match their studies. If that’s the case, what’s the point of following those same paths? Should I even consider BBA, or would engineering give me the same (or maybe better) opportunities, especially for things like MTO jobs?\n\nAt the same time, I don’t want to spend years studying something technical like engineering only to end up working in a bank or a regular company in a role that feels completely unrelated.

I dont wanna try hard for four years. I'd say I'm a decent student.

We built it and took it to $$k on revenue in less than 4 months w/ profitability. We closed later because we realized there are not enough quality engineers. Bad unit economics.\n\nNow I'm looking for people who want to build something, here's what I'm looking for:\n\n1. Tech: I already have my ex co-founder who used to handle tech, I'm seeking another guy who knows about AI and building AI more than anyone.\n\n2. Business: Talk w/ Clients, get clients, hiring, CX expanding etc. basically the CEO.\n\nI'm looking for people who're still in University or less. If you're someone from IUB, NSU, AIUB, BRAC that's way better. You've to be damn obsessed w/ the business btw and have to work full-time.\n\nI'll handle the financials, all back-office work, and you can use my previous experiences as well.

What is Bengali Culture, today and traditionally? Whenever I go back to visit Bangladesh, I'm not allowed to travel anywhere without supervision, and it's a rather limited area (though I am an adult now, so maybe it will be different now), so I don't really feel like I have any idea of what Bangladesh is actually like. Whenever I ask my parents about this, it feels like I get the more Islamic version of things rather than how things are normally. I want to know more about the people and culture beyond the limited view I have been able to experience.\n\nI don't know if this content is helpful at all but my dad's family is from Old Dhaka, and my mom's family is from  Noakhali but like 99% are in Dhaka now.",

My question is, how do they count the marks? Do they require an overall total marks of those subjects combined (Like- 530/600) \n? Or do they require marks in individual subjects (Like- 180/200)? My physics 1st didn't go that well, I think I'll get around 85/100 but my 2nd paper went well, will probably get more than 90/100. So I'm a bit worried. And from I heard their mark requirements depend on each year's result, and the physics questions were really difficult, especially mcq. So I think the results will be a bit worse compared to other years this year. Am I safe? Will I be able to apply to buet (hopefully)? I don't want to worry but I can't help being so anxious thinking about it..\nPlease let me know, the ones who know about this well :) ",

        "body": "I'm sitting for HSC 2025 exam.I need post hsc admission phase guideline. Mainly aiming for DU or SUST or any prestigious/decent uni preferably in CSE. Now im not gonna sugarcoat and be completely honest I didn’t have the best preparation or routine during my academic life. So far exam's has been going pretty decent. So inshallah. Buet is already out of reach since i have 4.94 in my ssc. Due to post-pandemic burnout,depression and just lack of discipline I went from a straight A student(barely ever missing A+ in school) to failing mostly and barely passing.My biggest issue is procastination and perfectionism combo which paralyzes me into not being able to even try. I still see glimpse of my own potential which is what makes me keep standing up after a bad day. I'm self-aware enough to be able to say I can do it or at least get closer if I really gave my best. The main problem is starting for me. And maintaining  consistency. Anyways the interest in CSE didn't come from societal pressure or anything actually i haven't even told anyone my dream properly cz what if they judges me and thinks \"im not cut out for it\" which is a thought that keeps haunting me too. I did research days after days to find if I was really interested or not same way I did research about medical to see if I was actually NOT interested in it. In both case I seemed to be right. Now enough with babbling. I'd say my fundamental basic is pretty decent but there are lackings mostly due to lack of practice and procastination. So back to my point I do have genuine interest and determination to do this to prove myself to make something out of myself. To create a life worth living where im not constantly surviving day to day of self-hate,low self esteem, guilt and regret. Mainly focusing on hsc now of course..however my question is what should be my next step after 6th aug. Or 20 august(till practicals). If anyone managed to read till now just drop your thought or any sort of guideline. To avoid making my life harder I have decided and have been term with the fact that even if I don't get into CSE my life won't be over. So getting into any decent uni would be my main priority and goal. However I have genuine interest in CSE and would love to make something out of it.And i guess in some sense aiming for cse could be foolish given my academic situation. So If you have any other suggestions for majors please drop them below!!!!!I am not that aware about the whole admission process since during my academic year when my friends were doing pre-medical courses I couldn't even dare to dream ab a big uni cz i was barley passing in exams still. If I don't mess up and manage to get A+ in all the rest 6 exams I will surely get GPA5(at least my calculation says so but well luck can always play funny games given i missed my gpa5 in ssc by 3 marks) Pray for me so i can do well enough in HSC to be able to at least APPLY.

A man whose life embodied the sacrifice and spirit of 1971. So many of our heroes are gone. And with each passing, we lose not just a person, but a piece of our collective spine. I pray for Montu Bhai. May Allah grant him the highest place in Jannatul Firdous. Ameen.*\n\nMontu Bhai was not just a guerrilla commander; he was the pillar on which so much of our early resistance stood. In the chaotic days after March 25, when national leaders were being hunted down, it was Montu who helped Tajuddin Ahmad and Barrister M Amir-ul Islam to get out of Dhaka. It was Montu who sheltered the core student leaders in Keraniganj. It was Montu who organized food, protection, and morale when the city collapsed into silence and blood.\n\nThe Pakistanis knew this. During the Jinjira massacre, they weren’t asking for positions or platoons. They were searching for one man, Mustafa Mohsin Montu. And yet, no one gave him up. Even in the face of death, the people protected him. That is leadership. That is love.\n\n[Image: Montu.](https://preview.redd.it/czz62e0bs87f1.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddc7966dc571f27f04842accf9944b33d7ab2f39)\n\nIn the first stage of the war, Montu helped organize hundreds of langarkhanas in Keraniganj for refugees pouring out of Dhaka. He also set up over 20 training camps for young freedom fighters. He didn’t run to the border; he stood firm and organized from the inside.\n\nWe forget too easily in this country. Montu Bhai never boasted. He never sold his sacrifice. He lived humbly, carried his principles quietly, and left this world with his integrity intact.\n\nWe, as a nation, never truly honored him as we should have. But history will. His story belongs to the soul of this land.\n\n*Some of the information and war recollections were originally written by journalist* [*Ahmad Ishtiaq*](https://www.facebook.com/ahmad.istiak.1971)*.*",

Many of you seem confused about what to do, where to go, and how to start preparing.\n\nSo, I’ve decided to summarize everything to help clear things up.\n\nBroadly speaking, admission tests can be categorized into three groups:\n\n1. Medical\n\n\n2. Engineering\n\n\n3. Science and Technology Universities\n\n\n\nIn this post, I’ll be focusing on Engineering admission tests, specifically BUET. If you need information or guidance about other categories, feel free to inbox me.\n\n\n---\n\nBUET Admission Test Overview\n\nBUET’s admission process is divided into three main stages:\n\n1. Application Submission\n\n\n2. Shortlisting of Eligible Candidates\n\n\n3. Admission Tests (Preliminary and Final)\n\n\n\nPreliminary Exam\n\nFormat: MCQ\n\nSubjects &amp; Marks Distribution:\n\nPhysics – 33\n\nMath – 34\n\nChemistry – 33\n\n\nTotal Marks: 100\n\nTypical Cut-off: 45–50\n\n\nFinal Exam\n\nFormat: Written\n\nSubjects &amp; Marks Distribution:\n\nPhysics – 130\n\nMath – 140\n\nChemistry – 130\n\n\nTotal Marks: 400\n\n\n\n---\n\nPreparation Tips\n\nThe syllabus is based on the HSC 2024 curriculum.\n\nFrankly speaking, you’ve already covered the majority of the syllabus in A Levels.\n\nThe remaining topics can be managed within the time left.\n\n\nHere’s what you should focus on initially:\n\nComplete the HSC textbooks\n\nSolve previous years’ questions\n\nRegularly take practice exams\n\n\nHaving a good mentor or guide can make a big difference in your preparation.\n\n\n---\n\nI’m attaching the official eligibility requirements for BUET admission below. Let me know if you need help understanding them or planning your prep. Best of luck to all!",

And this shit is not true for admission tests only, but also for any board exams like SSC or HSC. Students have to wait for hours, press the refresh button maybe hundreds of times, praying for the server to be up again.\n\nI mean, what does it take them to solve it?

I was kept running from desk to desk all day, explaining the problem, but I was not allowed to speak to any officer or assistant director.\n\nDespite showing proof of payment, I was told that I would have to reapply and pay the fee again — and I would not get a refund.\n\nNow I am stuck.\n\nI have to pay 5750 taka.

        "body": "Mahfuz Alam (Mahfuj Abdullah), now an Adviser in the interim government, was one of the key minds behind the July Movement, but remains underappreciated. While leaders like Nahid, Hasnat, and Sarjis gained public spotlight, Mahfuz stayed behind the scenes, shaping strategy, maintaining ideological discipline, and steering the movement toward long-term change.\n\nDespite his deep influence, many now question his role. Some even dismiss him as a political beneficiary rather than a revolutionary. The recent water bottle incident at Jagannath University, where protesters shouted “Shanda Mahfuz”, sums up the absurdity of this erasure through sheer disrespect.\n\nHis post-uprising seminar speech at Dhaka University was a spark of brilliance and statesmanship: “We must disinfect, not destroy BAL, for the sake of a future democratic Bangladesh.” A bold, mature call for justice without vengeance. A vision to reform, not erase. That kind of moral clarity is rare in revolutionary moments.\n\nWhat also places Mahfuz uniquely among July leaders is his wide and deep understanding of political philosophy, ranging from capitalism to Islamic political thought to Marxism, as well as history of the world. This breadth is consistently reflected in his speeches and even in his social media statuses, offering analytical depth rather than rhetorical flair. I’d say only Nahid shares a similar intellectual stature among his peers, though their styles differ.\n\nSo, why is Mahfuz unpopular among many? Is it because he wasn’t loud enough during the July movement? Because he wasn’t meme-friendly? Or is it because his ideas cut too deep, too complex for the era of soundbites and hero worship? Or is it because he has become critical of Jamat&amp;Shibir recently, on the question of 1971?\n\nAs I am living abroad, I don't get people's pulse that has actually rendered his unpopularity. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. Does brilliance without theatrics always get ignored?",

        "body": "I have no misconceptions that doing well in Pure math is easy, as it is a very complex and challenging subject. But I’ve always been passionate about mathematical theory, and while it was not my primary target during admission season, I got a chance into DU Pure Math and I’m actually quite happy about it. I’ve been going through some undergrad books and courses and it still seems pretty interesting to me, though it’s very tough. \n\nI’m not a prodigy or a genius, like my family members, and I have no false delusions of grandeur. All I want is to be able to choose where and how to spend the next 4 years of my academic life in peace. But like the proverbial vulture that feeds on insecurities instead of decay, my parents are constantly belittling and manipulating me to gravitate towards EEE instead. I got EEE at Ahsanullah, and to be very honest, I have very little interest in going. The only reason I had initially accepted before my DU results was that I could shift from EEE to Materials science (which was my primary target at BUET, but I couldn’t get in) in the long run, but I have absolutely no interest towards EEE as a subject itself. But now, after asking around far and wide, I’ve seen that I can shift to Computational materials science research using my degree. I’m already learning code so that I can be very skilled by the time I graduate, and I’m also looking for undergraduate research opportunities in Bangladesh either in maths itself or in any related field. \n\nBut, the one problem is I’ve always been kinda weak in geometry and mechanics. Tbh, they’ve never been properly explained to me. But my father is using this as a leverage to try to prove to me that despite any amount of hard work I put towards my degree, the fact that I’m inherently a little weak in these fields proves that I’ll fail miserably if I press on with maths. He says that pure math should only be studied by those who are ‘naturally brilliant’, that I’ll see those prodigies in my department easily getting good results and it’ll demotivate me, that I just need to ‘tough it out’ the next 4 years and that an engineering degree will guarantee that I can shift to anything I want to shift to in the future and that ‘it’ll preserve my dignity’ because apparently, maths is not a ‘dignified subject’. \n\nIs doing well in maths really as impossible for someone average like me? These doubts have been eating my insides like maggots. I’m scared that I’ll fight for my dreams and end up being a failure. I’m scared of facing my parents in that alternative. They’ve blamed me for most of the problems in their lives anyway, what would they do to me then? \n\nThinking of going to AUST makes me feel suffocated. A vibrant environment, freedom, these have always been necessary to my survival, and it was with the dream that id finally be free after my admission period that sustained me throughout the long, arduous, caged years of my life so far. I’m supposed to go back inside a cage now? ",

        "title": "Ongoing Student Protest at KUET",
        "body": "**Assalamualaikum, I hope the people of Reddit are doing well.**\n\n  \nThis post is about the current protest situation happening at Khulna University of Engineering &amp; Technology (KUET), Khulna. Politics on campus was banned, yet a couple of individuals were working in the shadows to revive political activities with the help of a certain political party.\n\nOn the 18th of February, 2025, the general student body discovered these involvements and went to the administration building to demand strict action against the students involved in such activities. Later that day, the accused, together with local goons and political leaders, attacked the campus. More than 150 students were injured, with several severe cases due to the use of deadly weapons by the locals.\n\nEven though the faculty body and Vice-Chancellor were informed about the situation while it was happening, they failed to provide any security to the campus or its students. A protest was held with several demands, one of them being the resignation of the Vice-Chancellor, but the VC failed to comply with any of them. In response, the halls were shut down, but the students still chose to remain and continue protesting. As a result, the internet and water supply were cut off. Anyone living on the outskirts of Khulna knows the importance of pure water in that area, so the students were forced to leave the campus. Before leaving, a part of the student body went to Dhaka, held a press conference at the Shahid Minar of Dhaka University, and submitted a memorandum to the chief advisers.\n\nAs the protest was dying down, a portion of the student body returned to campus to gain access to the halls and continue their protest. They spent an entire day and night outside the administration building with no roof over them, yet the administration didn’t reopen the halls. Instead, a false FIR was filed on false charges at the local police station, accusing 22 named students and 20 unknown students. Rather than standing with the students, the faculty body along with local political leaders sided with the Vice-Chancellor. While the protest continued through various activities, the administration issued suspension notices to 37 students based on false allegations.\n\nFinally, the student body decided to go on a hunger strike. It has now been almost 22 hours, and due to the intense heat and humidity in the Khulna outskirts, a few students have fallen ill, and two have lost consciousness while praying.\n\nI am attaching some pictures and a link for anyone who wants to know more about the issue. Students from different universities and alumni have already held rallies and shown solidarity. If anyone can help share or speak up about the issue, it would mean a lot. The government has yet to take action, as has the university administration. The credibility of the government is now in question.\n\n \n\nWebsite: [Rokto-KUET](https://roktakto-kuet.vercel.app/18feb)\n\nFB Page : [KUET Insiders ](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61571893928995)\n\nAnother one: [কুয়েট ১৯ ](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61573232256752)\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwz1f9melcwe1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3648450618fc997130985e2aaf9cd82ace2969a9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqz1x7melcwe1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc93fd4c6687f4888014221e9da2fe3efaebc941\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gk6i18melcwe1.jpg?width=723&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03a09b5faf2bb10378b8c7a057e473dab0baa3e4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tk05i6melcwe1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0f228f6fec4ec3c90afc790613f1e14b796c9e1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iugei9melcwe1.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d2b10871f114106532bf7df7bf6d20c5b13b33c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hiv8h6melcwe1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e89b21fb28860b452df3a8e4c852ed64e7f9f9c\n\n ",

I have a background in Civil Engineering and am looking to start a business in the Civil Engineering sector. Initially, I considered an MBA, but after reviewing the course curriculum for the MSc program, I have developed an interest in it. \n\nHowever, I am unsure if this program is worthwhile for me. I have searched the internet but have not found any useful information. I am confused about whether the MSc program aligns with my career goals or if I should focus solely on the MBA. \n\nI am not interested in any core Civil Engineering MSc programs, such as Structural Engineering or Transport. I was looking for a program in Construction Management or Project Management, but I couldn't find any at BUET. There is a program called AEM (Advanced Engineering Management), but it seems to be more geared toward Industrial and Production Engineering.\n\nAny guidance or insights would be helpful!

This year I have taken the admission test in several universities, and I have been offered Economics in all universities except DU.

I have checked the course modules and found that most of the courses in Health Economics are pure Economics, with only a few related to Public Health. So, I think it should not make much of a difference.\n\nSo, taking Health Economics gives me the opportunity to study Economics while also studying at DU.\n\nFrom my perspective, which would be better for me?\n\nBUP/CU/SUST/JNU Economics or DU Health Economics",

        "body": "I am studying CSE in BRAC University (3rd year), and I am hating it more and more with each passing semester. I am struggling and barely passing my classes.\n\nSince the university has shifted to the new campus, it literally has become a meat grinder. Many students believe the university is failing more students now on purpose to make more money out of them. Also, they take almost 1000 students in CSE per intake, 3 intakes a year. So talks about BRACU’s money hunger don’t seem out of place.\n\nRegardless, I’ve started seeing CSE as a scam, at least here in South Asia. Most universities here, they are not trying to make us “computer scientists”; they are mainly selling us the idea of immigration to the West. Get a degree, move West, work in Big Tech—that’s the picture of a successful CSE grad here. Such a great dream!!!—slaving for billionaires while the poor get poorer.\n\nI don’t get motivated to study CS just for CS’s sake anymore. However, I’ll give it its versatility—tech skills are useful in almost every field now. Therefore, I don’t want to drop it either.\n\nSo, I tried pursuing a minor in anthropology for the last 2 semesters. Did a few courses in anthro, thinking it’d balance out the tech grind with something human. Nope! That department’s just full of smug “ummm actually☝️....” type students and profs — whose whole deal is, “you are wrong, I know more, and let me tell you why I am better than you.” (I am painting here with a broad brush, and I am sorry.) A friend warned me that our anthro department is insufferable, and seems he was right. Can’t find my place there, &amp; now I’m back to square one.\n\nOne of my friends, seeing my condition, suggested that I should think about doing a minor in economics — it has some utility with CS skills, unlike anthro. He has a point, but I’m scared I may hate it too. Asked a senior student, and he said econ is as complicit in the “work-for-the-rich” game I hate in CS.\n\nI don’t know what to do right now. I can’t keep on with just CS, minors don’t seem to be clicking for me. I’m too scared to drop out too — my parents have spent too much already.\n\nI am so lost. Please give me some advice.\n\n",

However, due to various reasons and factors, I no longer wish to pursue BME. Instead, I want to study Pharmacy, which has always been another field of interest for me. I don’t believe I’ll secure a spot in a public university for Pharmacy, so I’ve decided to apply for it at NSU.\n\nAt first, my parents were supportive of this plan, but now they seem to be trying to umm.... persuade me to choose KUET instead. They are encouraging me to take the opportunity if I get an acceptable subject there, since it’s a public university. However, I’m not particularly passionate about engineering.\n\nFor context, I come from an English Medium (EM) background, and I thought it might be worth mentioning, as EM students are taught quite differently compared to HSC students, which could influence the decision when selecting a university.\n\nI have to go to KUET on18th for admission.

        "body": "Okay so let me give a breif about myself at first. I am a ssc25 candidate. My prep is good. Can secure 1200 InShaAllah. \nI am fighting with Dilemma of should I continue NCTB(HSC) or shift to A levels. I have clear goals of my career. Struggling with the roadmap. \n\nMy plan is to get into DU IBA. and also keeping a gate open for USA(not an important part of this reddit). So my first question is, Can I apply for DU IBA if I shift to A levels? Are the admission test curriculum that different? As far I know questions come from English, Math, analytical ability, so can I take the prep from A levels? and also Can I get into DU IBA if I am from A levels background? Will it be easier to get into DU IBA from A levels? \n\nI will share my vision so you can have a clear understanding and give me better suggestions .My goals are very clear. Whether I study nctb or a levels, My only target is DU IBA. My backup is NSU/ Brac. And nothing else no other universities . I want to cut off all the unnecessary things from my academics to reach to my target. So would it be easier to get into iba if I shift to A levels? In my say (CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG) having this set goal, HSC will be a buzzer for me as I dont care about any other admissions even will not give any.Studying HSC will be an unnecessary stress. So studying fewer subjects in A levels(I will come to that, I know A levels isnt easy.) will help me to focus more on my target and cut of subjects which will really not help in future.\n\nMy second question comes to should I really shift to A levels from NCTB? I listen students cant really cope up after shifting to A levels as it is a whole new curriculum also the study is also more harder and deeper than HSC but lesser in volume. So sticking to the same curriculum(NCTB) is the best. But I have a different say here.(CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG). For me I believe A level will be easier to me than HSC as I can pick my few desired subject and will get marks only what I deserve, no more no less. unlike NCTB where I need to study EVERYTHING, so here pressure really goes off when I shift. No need to study everything(studies that wont relate with my career). \nComing to curriculum, as far I know- the syllabus of A levels is more advanced than HSC and also similarly big. I don’t have any problem with it as long as I study my desired subjects.  my understanding part of the brain is better than memorizing. I suck at\nMemorizing. If A levels curriculum heavily depends on understanding, logical and analytical ability, writing actual content in exams no sugar coating, less volume syllabus than HSC. Then if this is the case then I can cope up with A level shift. I believe most of the people cannot cope up because they can’t catch the advances topic, in my case that wouldn’t be the problem.\n\nverify me here and if you have any experiences, kindly do share it. Anyone with shifts or studied/studying A levels?Also anyone from DU IBA’s would love to hear tips from you. So Should I really shift to A levels according to my criteria? Or stick with NCTB for my goals. Which one will be better? Also note that my perspective can be wrong anywhere, that is why I am seeking advice. Kindly Help me, Will really appreciate it. Thanks for reading.\n\nApologies for the reddit being too long. \n\nP.S - I will pursue an entrepreneurial career. My family background, financial condition is also good. \n\n\n",

        "title": "China sends machinery for domestic defence industry in Bangladesh",
        "body": "China has transferred various types of military technology to Bangladesh, aiming to establish a domestic defense industrial base. A research paper titled \"National Image of China in Bangladesh\" revealed this information. The launch event was attended by former Dhaka University professor and executive director of the Center for Alternative, Imtiaz Ahmed, and China's ambassador Yao Wen.\n\nBefore the Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus' visit to China, the study provided insights into the defense relationship between Bangladesh and China. If all goes well, the Chief Advisor is scheduled to visit China on March 26 and meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on March 28.\n\nThe research paper indicates that Beijing has transferred technology to Bangladesh Ordnance Factory and Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory for small and medium-sized weapons, helping to build a domestic defense industrial base. In 2012, the Bangladesh Navy included its first domestically-produced patrol ship, constructed at Khulna Shipyard with Chinese assistance.\n\nAccording to the study, the bilateral relationship between the two countries remained unchanged even after the power transition in August 2024. In October 2024, the People's Liberation Army Navy sent warships Qi Jiguang and Jing Gangshan to Chittagong port on a goodwill visit.\n\nThe report highlights that this defense relationship remained intact despite changes in power in Dhaka. Following the interim government's takeover, it was the first foreign naval visit. The new interim government expressed its desire to strengthen defense and security cooperation with China. At a seminar held in Dhaka in October 2024, Foreign Advisor Md. Touhid Hossain emphasized the government's willingness to continue bilateral defense cooperation, confirming that Bangladesh seeks further defense collaboration with China, identifying it as an essential element of bilateral relations.\n\n### Military Agreements\nIn 2002, both countries signed a defense cooperation agreement encompassing military training and defense production, reaching a significant milestone in defense and security relations. Notably, China was the first country to sign such a defense agreement with Bangladesh.\n\nIn 2014, four agreements were signed, including one where the People's Liberation Army (PLA) would provide free training and military assistance to the Armed Forces of Bangladesh (AFB). Another agreement stated that the PLA would assist in establishing a language lab at Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP). Bangladesh and China also cooperate in UN peacekeeping missions. In May 2024, both countries held a historic joint military exercise, reaffirming their close defense ties.\n\n### Defense Equipment Purchases\nDefense cooperation forms a crucial basis for bilateral cooperation between Bangladesh and China. Since establishing formal relations in 1975, defense cooperation has been a significant priority. Due to political changes in 1975, China became a reliable partner for military equipment and defense assistance. Many experts believe that since 1975, Dhaka has leaned more towards the Pakistan-China axis, as Soviet military cooperation declined, creating an opportunity for China to fill the gap. Bangladesh's strategic considerations have made defense cooperation with China more dynamic.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1980, Chinese defense assistance became central to bilateral relations, supplying 78% of Bangladesh's weapons during this period. According to the research report, Bangladesh is currently the second-largest buyer of Chinese weapons. From 2019 to 2023, Bangladesh accounted for 11% of China's total arms sales. Ranked as the 26th largest arms buyer globally, Bangladesh purchased about 72% of its total weapons from China between 2019 and 2023. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Bangladesh spent $2.59 billion on arms purchases from China between 2010 and 2019, including maritime patrol ships, corvettes, tanks, fighter jets, and land-to-air and anti-ship missiles.\n\nThe Bangladesh Army uses modern Chinese weapons like VT-5 light tanks and MBT-2000 main battle tanks. The Bangladesh Air Force operates advanced Chinese trainer jet fighters like K-8 and short-range air defense systems like FM-90. The Bangladesh Navy purchased a pair of Chinese Ming-class submarines worth $205 million and a new generation of Chinese Type 056 stealth corvettes for its surface fleet.\n\n### Unconditional Sales\nThe research paper states that China's weapons supplies come without conditions linked to Bangladesh's internal political environment, providing critical military equipment that other countries may not offer.\n\nDefense cooperation with China has significantly boosted Bangladesh's ambitious military modernization campaign, \"Forces Goal 2030,\" making China Bangladesh's primary defense partner. Familiarity, tradition, and preference drive Bangladesh's armed forces to acquire modern Chinese weapons. Additionally, Beijing provides modern, high-tech, and sophisticated military equipment at relatively low costs compared to other countries.\n\nBoth countries have demonstrated positive and constructive attitudes toward enhancing cooperation in peacekeeping, development, and conflict resolution. Military equipment purchases and supplies have been integral parts of defense cooperation since the early days of bilateral relations. Over time, defense cooperation between the two countries has evolved from merely arms sales to a more comprehensive partnership.\n\nNews- [Bangla Tribune](https://www.banglatribune.com/national/889759/)",

        "body": "হ্যালো সবাই!\n\nThis is an update post after another week exploring this country.\n\nDuring this week, I had a look at the old Dhaka and at the two other UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Bangladesh: the Mosque city and the Buddhist Vihara. The third one being the Sundarbans, that I explored last week.\n\nBangladesh is one of this country, where different religions got entwined together during the centuries of its history and left indelible archaeological structures for us and future generations to marvel upon. It may be only old stones, but they are full of history and if you are interested these two videos from UNESCO, [one from the Mosque city](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=EHOHY--d8OM) and the other from [the Buddhist Vihara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=ufgT3TLydGg), take you to a little travel not only in space but also in time.\n\nDuring the Pohela Boishakh all the religions mixed up to celebrate together the Bengali New Year. It's an interesting celebration mixing dances, processions of giant sculptures and colourful clothing. The flower crowns are so delicate and beautiful! Here is [a little film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=qmjQnSvy5Mc) about this one of a kind new year. \n\nAnd if you have still some energy left, you can try [one of this dance cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=p411brMtxP0) and be prepared for the 14th of April.\n\nJokes aside, I really wish for the saree to expand out from the Indian subcontinent and into Europe because this seems to be the perfect piece of clothes to survive global warming.\n\n Anyway, the sun has set, time to eat!\n\n For this second week, I tried Beef Nihari. The only recipes with beef that I knew of consisted of slow cooking it in red wine or brown beer, and I was curious to learn how to make it another way. It's particularly strong in flavour and spices and the (weird) Bakarhani that I made, goes well with it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5yr88nzgfne1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fff12b769a6f03a8bfc33f605d09f4e8f82ee928\n\nFor dessert, I made some Chomchom, and it was tasty but weird. It's basically sweet cheese rolled in coconut. Very strange for my taste buds! But now I can finally say the sentence \"*Chomchom is yum-yum!*\".\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hyprtp5ohfne1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f26b81071f00f3d8ca8f7cc452bcb745c3d36240\n\nSo, while listening to some [Bangla Lofi Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGBTpuo_tGo&amp;list=PLMIyGeKcAq-tCFfGBKyQTDmx4a96EhZZV&amp;index=10) I'm leaving the Bay and will sail for my new destination. It was a pleasant introduction to the culture of the Indian Subcontinent, and I'm looking forward to virtually visit the next neighbouring countries: Pakistan and the massive India.\n\nTo change things a little bit, I will be using [Random Country Generator](https://random.country/) to decide where I go. Next week I will be visiting... &gt;!Saint Kitts and Nevis!&lt;!\n\nবিদায়!",

        "body": "I left my home after SSC and got admitted to NDC at the age of 17. I mostly lived in a hostel with some amazing friends. But I could not perform academically as I was supposed to. I couldn’t concentrate on my study, thus I ended up not having a five point gpa and eventually got admitted into NSU, CSE.\n\nI started my university life very strongly as I expected myself to do. But then Covid happened and I had to move back home where I already had a very vulnerable relationship with my father. There wasn’t a single night when we both didn’t fight. Before my college had closed, I fell deeply in love with a girl in my early university days. But long term relationship did not work for me and it became as obnoxious as a vipers spit. We eventually broke up and it broke me into so many pieces. I once again fell into the trap. I got behind my studies and kept ended up with bad grades where most students were taking advantage of online exams.\n\nWhen my college reopened in Jan, 2022, I tried to pull myself up. I started doing some tuitions to earn my pocket money. I earned around 22k per month from two tuitions and its suffice to say it was more than enough for me as I was and still is living with my grandparents. I also managed to run a small jersey business online for some time to have a taste of managing a business! I tried to join a reputed research lab in my university and despite having a poor cgpa, I successfully did. \nI have been working there since then. I have two research papers (Poster papers) in my name so far. But my academic comeback never actually happened. \n\nSince I came back Dhaka after Covid, I was happy with myself. Earning a decent amount of money and being able to spend that on myself gave me a lot of confidence. I always thought no matter what happens I will land on my feet In sha Allah. \n\nI was about to graduate last December. But my amma got sick last November and she was diagnosed with stage four cancer. I couldnt graduate and ended up with some I grades. I have been running from places to places with my mother for her treatment since then. I am yet to graduate and trying to change my plans for the future.\n\nI have the most beautiful relationship with the most beautiful girl and its been four years. I never planned to stay and settle here in this country. I wanted to apply this September and be gone by next year with my girl. That was my ultimate plan for my future. I did not gather enough skills for job market as I never thought of getting jobs here. To work as a full time RA till I leave the country was basically my plan. \n\nBut the doctors said amma’s life expectancy is about two years and I dont think I can leave my amma right now. So I am currently focusing on developing some skillset for me to get a decent job in Data Sector (Data analytics mostly) so that I can make a living out of it and marry my girlfriend. \n\nI plan to land a good enough remote job by the end of this year on Data Analytics and make the marriage happen. So that even if my amma dies, she can see that I landed on my feet.\n\nAm I day dreaming about anything or am I overthinking about anything? At this point, I don’t really know if its possible to pull this off or if I am capable enough. \n\nI wrote this with severe headache and probably wrote in the cheapest and most confusing way possible! If you read this, drop me if you have any advice for me! and Thank you! \n\n\n\n\n",

I will be attending 45 bcs viva and 46 bcs written exams.But my family is super toxic....24*7 quarrel happens between my two sisters and mother.My retired father acts weird and extremely annoying. He wants his children to remain in nanny state especially me.For this reason my younger sister lose her mind and continuously failed hsc exams but now thankfully continuing studies through open University. My elder sister got divorced in 2022 because my ex brother in law cheated on my sister with his childhood love.Now She's living with us in a 3 room flat... And sharing room with my younger sister.They quarrel every moment for every petty reasons like sharing bed,blocking pathway in the room,not keeping the things at places.My elder sister kept some money in bank account of my father.... When she demands money from him... He just ignores...For that reason she fumes and makes the house in hellfire in regular intervals.My father sneakily enters and checks my sisters out whether they are doing anything wrong or not.... These also brings chaos to the house.My mother understands my struggle and she is empathetic but she tries to escape this by regular visit to my aunt's house.I told my mother see that is the only reason I never had a relationship.... Who in a sane sense give a girl to this family?These made me severely inferior around my friends who are getting married and having children.I just feel very lonely deep inside.I do have romantic side like SRK in the movies but I do carry a mask of misogynistic sigma male persona like as if I never needed woman in my life.Women in my school, college, varsity knew me either shy or arrogant... This is just defense mechanism to avoid female interaction. Let me tell you the intensity of their quarrelsome behaviour.... In the morning like fojor time they abuse each other ku**a,ma**,khan*i etc khati bangali bosti galis.My family was not like this toxic from the beginning but toxicity was there always.Recenly I developed feeling for a girl.... She was not interested in haram relationship so she wanted that the guy who wants her should approach her parents...but recently she posted stories in Instagram that she is taken....so I unfollowed her and she blocked from all the socials when I confronted her.She was really feminine, sweet girl with long shiny hair with gorgeous face. EXACTLY MY TYPE.I really lost her and feeling like a utter loser....I would have asked her out but again family dynamics made me hesitant... She must have though what a timid guy I should move to next...She casually asked me for coffee though...I chickened out and told her in Shaa Allah in the future.Now I have lost apetite for food....I hardly eat... Forcefully concentrate myself to studies...But I question Allah why did He send me in this family?\n\nI used to work as an assistant engineer in a private reputed organization. But when the covid hit I resigned and focused on my gov job preparation like people usually do. I KNOW THIS WAS WORST DECISION of my life....but before covid my family was not that toxic or maybe it was... I just could not find out because of classes and friendly hang outs.I have only two friends living in my proximity now.One friend got a job as officer general at Janata Bank in Sylhet..Another friend's father got cancer so he remains busy in the hospital... Usually we meet around DU area at weekends...whenever I feel too heavy I miss my 2nd friend who is now busy for his father.\n\n\nI WILL DEFINITELY SUCCEED.but as a man I want some useful suggestion from you.\nHow do I get rid of this suicidal thoughts?\nWill any dream girl come to my life seeing the ugly side of my family?Usually men are judged by the status of their family background in this country...I AM COOKED in that space.I can't stay celibate for life.\n\nMaybe in the April.... Exam of recruitment of Senior officer may held.I will crack it In shaa Allah...My preparation is too good. HOPEFULLY FINANCIALLY I WILL BE COME BACK.\n\nOn the top of that my father never agreed to finance my studies abroad...I AM HIS LIFELONG INVESTMENT.... HOW CAN I GET RID OF HIM? 🙂\nI hate brown parents....I even can't tell anyone that my shitty father and mother who are emotionally unavailable to me won't finance... So I told my peers I am not interested. \n\n\nAnyway rant is finished. Save your fellow brother.....\nI want a normal life....normal family.... And a loving wife/fiance/gf.\nI desperately want normalcy.",

        "body": "One of the key means through which foreign interest groups expand their influence in Bangladesh is the so-called civil society, media, and research institutions. The United States funds various organizations in the name of democracy and human rights to protect its geopolitical interests and fulfill its objectives of regime change. The primary tools for this are the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), USAID, and other Western grant-based organizations. Through this funding, misleading campaigns are conducted under the guise of free expression, the legitimacy of elected governments is questioned, and long-term social structures are altered to serve American interests.\n\nOne part of this process is an online platform called Bangla Outlook, edited by Dr. Saimum Parvez. He leads the NED-funded CMIBD (Center for Media and Information Bangladesh), which primarily works to safeguard American interests under the pretext of so-called \"disinformation research.\" Saimum Parvez is a professor of International Relations at North South University and a Fulbright Scholar—a program controlled by the U.S. government.\n\nCMIBD also includes Zillur Rahman of Tritiyo Matra, who is known as a media analyst but is actively engaged in promoting a specific ideological agenda.\n\nThis network is also connected to Ali Riaz, who identifies as an academic and researcher and is involved in the so-called unconstitutional \"constitutional reform committee\" of the illegitimate Yunus government. He is primarily linked to NATO and the Atlantic Council, working to align Bangladesh’s political process with American interests. His various writings frequently label Bangladesh’s legitimate government as undemocratic, which is essentially part of a larger international agenda.\n\nThe United States does not rely solely on military intervention but also uses soft power to attempt regime change or control public opinion. Some key methods include:\n\nManipulation through civil society\n\nFunding specific individuals and organizations in the name of human rights, democracy, and freedom of expression\n\nCreating political instability through anti-government campaigns under the guise of \"protecting democracy\" and running anti-government propaganda through news platforms like Bangla Outlook, promoting specific political agendas under the pretext of \"disinformation research\" through institutions like CMIBD.\n\nInfluencing young people through scholarships and exchange programs.Those who receive these scholarships later engage in propaganda in favor of the United States.\n\nShahidul Alam &amp; the George Soros Network\n\nAmong the key promoters of foreign interests in Bangladesh is Shahidul Alam, who plays a significant role.

Venue was at Begum bodrunnesa girls college, went there smoothly. \n.\nBut the time I went there it was a....I can't..I can't express this in my words the intense pressure in people's face it just whole another level. There's a student was sitting in the bike and while and the speed of 50 MPH she was just reading her notebook, I mean damn brhh..!?\n.\nThe crazyness of medical Admission is insane. So, after going through 3 rounds of check post I entering the room, it was the pin drop silence. (Only the leg shaking sound was heard). Like that the exam started and it feels like I am in the vacuum of the universe.\n.\nSome how I managed one hour to stay there. And while leaving you all faced over the situation ,the whole media and parents gathering, (what a mess..). I won't say any thing about it cause you also suffered sometimes. And also our famous traffic jam was waiting for me on the road only returning home so how can we miss that..So yeah that's all my day roaming around medical admission. In one word, it was a whole Damn situation. \n.\nTo my brothers and sisters who joined this war, good wishes for your future.\nSelf-Realisation that I thought is that,\" I need to do something different or I will I get crushed.\"\n.\n🕊️ \n",

Last night a lot of my family members were invited for the celebration of my parents' 25th anniversary, and due to me being an admission candidate, the talk about what I was preparing for came up. I said I am prepping for DU B and C and their face went pale as I said something so blasphemous that their comprehension cannot imagine. Their first question was. \"you read science your entire life and passed HSC with great grades; why are you going for commerce or arts? Why are you not prepping for buet?\" and in response I said that I want to stay at BD, and the current engineering market is very bad, and I don't want to study in a discipline that has so little potential here at bd. and their response was there is a huge market for engineering at BD, and then they proceeded to say the most hilarious thing i have heard in a while. They said, \"Desher CSE er to onek demand.\" I just wanted to laugh so hard. As I didn't want to argue with them, I said that \"mama, amar to eto brain nai CSE porar\" and left the living room and said to myself how unaware people are when they give any advice. When the potential of CS graduates getting a stable and good-paying job is at an all-time low in the entire world. when tech mammoths are laying off people, there are so many uncles that give this unsolicited advice. These people just cannot think for 2 minutes before spewing out uncalled advice, and the fact is they aren't illiterate or anything. They just feed into the echo chamber without realising what is happening around the world. These people make me so mad it's just insane",

I chose to enroll in a Private University to get a good subject.\n\nIg my mom didn't like that. Now, like in every argument, she tells me \"Kono public e chance peye dekhate paros nai\", \"At least amra nijer ma baba ke khushi korte parsi DU te pore\", and if I correct her sentences or oppose her arguments in any other topic, she just replies with \"Tui toh DU teo tike thakte parli na\" and shii.\n\nIk that DU is tuff for this country, but Idk, now I don't even wanna study anything anymore. Her arguments are seriously getting under my skin. Today we argued and she said \"Tor toh kono bhalo bondhu o nai, amar bondhu ra at least DU te porse, tui toh gazadi der sathe ghure beras\" like tf???? She doesn't even say sorry, and if I argue too much, she decides to spit in my face and call me \"Kulangar\" and a \"Devil's spawn\".\n\nA couple of days back, I actually went to the private university I wanted to get admission in, just to check out the campus and to know a few details about the subject and the cost. My mom insisted that she come with me. I bought her along with me. I talked to the Apu at the office and got the details. BUT, when we were about to leave, my mom just stood up and told the Apu that \"Janen amar chele er ageh DU te chilo, and amio DU r student\". The girl sitting behind us just looked at me like \"Really, is this fr??\" I felt so embarrassed, I just walked out. So is anyone's mom like tis or am I just losing my mind over nothing?\n\nWhat type of Institutional pride is this?",

You have this competitive admission and only some very few toppers get the chance to enroll, by default you have the best students the country can offer. \n\nSo it must provide better quality and quantity of courses, learning and opportunities even though majors from both of the institutions go for similar higher studies and jobs?

This is the harsh reality of today and I have accepted it.\n\nToday I am seeking advice from you, if you could help me get a job which/ recommend me somewhere or even a startup would be nice. Just I don’t want to have my job outside of Dhaka city such as: Gazipur, Tongi, Savar etc. \n\nI am a recent graduate from University of Dhaka from Science faculty. I am one of the top students and faculty candidate of the department but teaching is not my passion so I really don’t prefer that. I have passion about Technology, business etc. My preference is very minimal. A decent amount of salary, a timely job and if possible 2 days weekend.\n\nIf any person can help me, it would be very nice.\n\n[N.B: You might be thinking if I am that qualified that how come I could not manage a job for myself? Actually I get many offers but as I mentioned they are at places where I don’t want to move. I live in a rented apartment alone in Dhaka and not willing to shift, so it will be very helpful if I can manage something inside the city which aligns with my passion.]\n\nThank you so much.\nArigato 🙇🏻",

        "body": "\nAssalamu alaikum.\n\nI'm  18M and my cousin is 25M.\nI've studied all my life at an international school in British curriculum and he studied in the national curriculum.\nHis mother would always show passive jealousy to my mom by saying things like \"why is your husband spending so much money on your son's education!\"\n\"Why is he making them study at international school!\"\n\"I didn't make my son study at an international school and I won't do it ever\"(these were her common dialogues over the years).\nAlso,more that I have a sibling elder brother who studies abroad too.\nMy aunt also had disagreements(she's my mom's sister)on why he is abroad,why not in this country.\n\nSo,now coming back to my cousin.\nHe would belittle my niece(who also studied in international school)that she could only get good results because she studied in international curriculum(she got all As in A levels)\n\nAnd now,fast forward,to me.\nNow,I work as an Assistant Teacher at a coaching center catered for English Medium students and he asked me for a job and I convinced my teacher and he gave him a job here.\nHe says to me now that *\"Getting good results from English Medium is so easy\"\n\"Your exams look so easy\"\n\"You don't don't need to do 'srijonshil' like us so you guys don't know our workload.\"\n\"Your questions are so easy\" even tho he himself admits that he cannot solve the questions himself.\nAnd that \"English Medium e to pora nai.\"\n\nAnd I was working as an assistant teacher there for 2 years before he came. \nAnd the within one month,he said that all students hate me,he \"heard\" students telling things which if I listened I would never go to that coaching again.\nAnd that the teacher is doing mercy on me by giving me a job even though I have stammering and that's why I'm paid low(my stammering isn't significant when I teach however.\nAnd there were other assistants who were paid lower than me ,even though they had higher qualifications.)\n\nAnd it's  contradictory that they will hate me  because the students have been texting for the last one month to come back and teach them because they don't understand anything from any other assistant currently since I left the coaching center to focus on my uni prep exams.\n\nAnd he also boasts that he can fuck over a person,like \"I can throw people under the bus and they will not even notice\".\nNote that he also has a lot of dark psychology and psychology books too.\nAnd he also belittles my niece who also studied from English Medium and she is now studying at Dhaka University.\n\nAnd recently he tells me that he's liking the job so much now that he's connecting with other teachers,and he's creating strong bonds with the staff members.And that he MAY like to be a permanent teacher (just a month ago he was saying vile stuffs about my teacher,who's the owner of the coaching center).\nAll this is happening after I left.\nAnd he told me that if I decide to rejoin I should first look for experience at another coaching for 6 months and then rejoin and ask for higher salary.\nBut he doesn't know that I already have 2 years of experience there,because he knows I only joined it this year only.\nAnd also if he leaves he may leave after June.\n\nI don't know man I can't get to trust him anymore.\n",

My GPA in SSC is 4.61 and in HSC is 4.00 (science background).\n\nI’ll be honest… I genuinely thought I was going to fail HSC, so I didn’t start admission prep early  (yeah, big mistake, I know). Now I’m aiming for B Unit in DU and and I’ve got around 35 days left to finish my syllabus.\n\nRight now I'm struggling mostly with Bangla grammar and GK. Bangla rules feel like they're flying over my head, and memorizing a big chunk of GK in such a short time is… not going smoothly. I'm trying to study 8–9 hours a day but I keep getting sleepy and losing focus. It’s frustrating because I really want to give this my best shot, but I’m not sure if I’m studying the right way or just wasting time.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar situation or has a practical way to cover Bangla grammar fast, memorize GK without frying my brain, or build up study stamina without crashing, I’d really appreciate your advice. I know I started late, but I’m trying to catch up as much as I can.\n\nThanks in advance.",

Most people will demotivate you or bully you if you are a nerd. It took 3/4 years to realize the truth. I was pretty active and cool back in college. My roommates were nerd af, got accepted to BUET and DMC, I was happy with a mediocre subject in DU. Later I moved abroad with scholarship. Now, I have become a nerd and a hard worker. I work my ass off to pay my bills, and maintain my scholarship. It feels amazing when you are financially independent and have good grades in Uni. I am quite familiar as a nerd and most hardworking person in the community, and I feel am super successful achieving all the things I have dreamed about. Don’t procrastinate, just work hard. If you fail, try harder. Remember, you will never met someone successful who had a great social life at 20. You need to understand the reality if you are not privileged. ",

        "body": "Hello, \n\nMy first post here. I am from Old town Dhaka and currently working as a high school teacher. My current financial condition seems to be worsening day by day not sure if cost of everything is increasing or my income source is going limited. Long story short, right now my salary range is around 15k. I don't have to pay rent as I live in our own house and also I am married but have parents living with us. \n\n  \nIt seemed all okay before 2024 but after 2024 it became very much certain for me that to continue family cost I must borrow money from others. What should I do extra? I am not the kind of teacher who believes in private teaching or tutions. Last time I had a tution was in 2012. I used to do freelancing duing my university period but right now everything seemed so upgraded and changed even my computer skills are not good enough to compete in the market.\n\n  \nNeed some serious financial suggestion here.  \n\n  \nThanks in advance\n\nIori",

That means fuck all lol\nAnyways I graduated with a decent cgpa in a decent subject and in over a year I got no job yet\nSo just trying to help others what could you do if you didn’t graduate yet as I am suffering since I didn’t do enough \n\n1. Private Companies (The big ones): ECAs with decent cgpa. Try to socialise with seniors who are working in good companies(try getting recommended). Prepare for initial screening exams.(that’s tough trust me due to the need of high accuracy in those exams-IBA type). And later stages are more about presentation and impromptu people skill show casing.\n\n2. Govt Jobs: oh boi, absolutely cooked. You better start preparing for bcs (bc apparently every govt job exam is held in this format).\n\nAlso I think if you haven’t decided whether to stay in bd or not, trust me leave the fuck outta here if it’s really not that serious for you to stay. You will do fairly well with less of the effort you will give here for these gut wrenching underpaying jobs.",

Back in 2019, when we sat for university exams, these places were more like the default backup option. If someone didn’t get into a public university, they’d just go to BRAC or NSU, no real competition, nothing serious entrance process.\n\nBut apparently, things have changed. My friend told me students now take *serious preparation* to get into BRAC, which really surprised me since I stopped tutoring about four years ago. He even showed me some recent sample questions from their admission tests. To me, they looked quite simple compared to buet-level questions. When I prepared for my buet admission test, it took me about three months of solid work, but these questions looked like a week of focused prep could be enough.\n\nNow I’m just wondering what’s actually happening here?\n\n* Are Bangladeshi students overall becoming weaker in foundational subjects, making these tests seem harder to them now?\n* Or are private universities like BRAC and NSU genuinely trying to improve their reputation and student quality by introducing admission tests?\n\nI honestly hope it’s the second one, but I’d love to hear others’ thoughts.",

As the admission for IBA at DU is next month Idk what to do as pursuing abroad is also taking up my time and I can't focus and also I am afraid that if I choose to study abroad the financial burden will be too much and I will crumble under the pressure.

He can't even ride a bus alone or go to any place alone. Because of her he has no friends and is suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts. I tried to talk but she says I'm jealous of him and I shouldn't teach her how to be a mother because she gave birth to us.\n\nPlease read🙏🏽\ntw:abuse\n\n\n\n\n\nI have an elder brother who's in his twenties. But my mom still treat him like a baby. He has no social skills,no friends, no outside world knowledge. He can't even ride a bus alone and can't go to any new places alone. I keep telling my mom to teach him all these like how to ride a bus and she should let him travel more often but my mom says he's to stupid to do that. Like no shit Sherlock because you never let him do anything alone. My brother still tries to take step for example he wanted to go to sylhet with his friend group but my mom Straight off said no and told him to travel with our family instead. He also got into rajshahi university but my mom didn't wanted him to go to rajshahi alone so she got him admitted into nsu instead. But he hates it. He keeps telling my parents how much he hates it and how much it's effecting his mental health but they both ignored. He could've went abroad as we have no money problem and he wanted to. But my mom didn't let him because he doesn't know how to cook,travel,talk or anything at all. \n\nRecently he dropped out all of his course because he hated it but now my parents especially my mom is pressuring him to prepare for the jahangirnagar university (second time) He's honestly suffering so much that it's also effecting my whole family. He now have anger issues-break things, hit me and sometimes threatens that he would khs. My mom is still not taking it seriously and she laughs and says we shouldn't make him angry or he'll harm us. I keep telling her to take it more seriously and to actually educate him about the outside world but she thinks she is actually doing him a favor and protecting him from the outside world. She always spoiled him and even when he did something really bad she ended up putting the blame on me. I don't talk to him anymore because he recently abused me physically but I still feel bad because honestly if my mom actually did something about everything it wouldn't have happend. He doesn't have any friends, doesn't go outside and only eats and sleeps in his room. He had a gf but she was toxic and ghosted him which is also ruining his mental health.\n\n\nI'm just so lost because I'm losing my brother and it's making me hate my whole family. I'm not hurt about anything he did but I'm hurt because I won't have a brother and I'll hate him. I keep telling my mom to do something but she says I should be more understanding and he's just not mature or that grown up to live alone or do anything alone.

Do you think studying CSE would be a good idea for me?\n\nAlso, which university should I aim for—NSU, BRAC, or somewhere else? Money is a factor by My parents can invest in me, but it has to be worth it—a really high return on investment, especially since private universities are expensive. Living in Dhaka would be extra cost too... \n\nI know some people say the university or degree doesn’t matter, but I’m lost. I feel like a younger brother trying to figure life out. If you’re studying CSE, I’d really appreciate your advice—and inboxing me would mean a lot too.",

        "body": "I haven't seen anyone talking about it here and I'd like to know how the redditors views this incident.\n\n**For the context:** *So on 4th of October around 9-10 AM, a mentally unstable boy who converted from hinduism to islam a few years ago who also happened to be a practicing muslim (he was seen praying in the NSU mosque) was seen desecrating some Qurans by kicking it around and stomping it for no good reason. Some faculties claim that he had been admitted to rehab some while ago for heavy drug abuse and had done some other heinous things in the campus and around the campus (allegedly). Now nobody really knows what was the actual reason for him to do that but that hardly matters. Some students tried to stop him but it didn’t help much and somehow he ended up leaving the campus after all the hooblas. Around midnight he was arrested from his rented apartment and while the police were taking him the mob somehow snatched him and gave him a good thrashing. Don’t know the story afterwards.*\n\nI personally believe disrespecting any religion shouldn’t be allowed in any society and the institution did the right thing by expelling him and banning him for life. But a capital punishment is way too far which is what the people are asking for. Some people are blaming secularism which is confusing because it doesn’t connect to the incident at all. I have seen some people comparing it to r\\*\\*e and mur\\*er which doesn’t make any sense because what he did doesn’t physically harm anyone. To be honest, what our blasphemy law is enough as a muslim majority state (2 years of imprisonment and monetary fines) but capital punishment takes it way too far to a point where I call it extremism. It is nowhere close to r\\*\\*e or m\\*\\*der. Also, some people are saying that secularism is what allowed this to happened. I want to ask how? I didn’t see anyone blaming secularism when the guy who was bailed by hefazat after harassing that one women, didn’t see anyone blaming secularism for all the vandalism that happens during puja every year. I see a good number of people calling hinduism and their scriptures fake and slandering them or saying things like they will go to hell. Isn’t that some sort of religious hate too? But the people don't seem have any problem about that. I want to know what the reddiors think of building society and government around one single organized religion just because of the majority.\n\n",

        "body": "I'm an Undergraduate student studying CSE at NSU. Its my final year (4th yr) but I'll need one extra year to complete my graduation, failing to complete all of 130 credits within four years due to taking many retakes. \n\nTill my A levels in 2021, I used to be a very good student. I used to study hard, and was a quick learner. I scored A-A*s in both O levels (2019) and A-Levels (2021)After the COVID-19 pandemic, I feel like my brain has drained all of its efficiency it had in the past.  From January 2022 I started my journey at NSU. \n\nTruth be told, I was confused what to study for higher education after completion of my A levels. Appealing to the hype, I sheepishly took CSE (and this herd mentality still exists among students even today. Not that I hadn't had any apriori idea about Computer Science (cuz I had it in my O levels), but I never had such passion towards it ever in my life. \n\nThough my parents (merely lip service) always used to say to take whatever Major Im interested, deep down, (just like typical Bengali parents) they expected me to choose either Medical or any field relating to Engineering. Cuz aparently, anything other these, aren't much of prestigious nor they ensure good, stable income. So I did, what I did; jumped in to the CSE bandwagon. But I didn't worry much cuz I had faith in the learning power of my brain, of which I was so confident that I felt I could trimph over all those discipline which have the largest of repulsion towards my affinity. And this is where I messed up bad.\n\nFrom the very first semester, I realized I could no longer remember contents of my studies as I could so easily before. Whenever I sat to study, my brain involuntarily gets distracted on literally anything. And since I was CSE student,  all of my studies are to be done with laptops or PC, so u got it. I never miss my classes, but failure to do self studying crippled me a lot. However, I barely managed to keep a CGPA of around 3.5 within my 1st year.\n\nFrom second, third year onwards, things worsened, I got many Bs,  few Ds and two C+s. I recovered a lot of the Ds and Cs by retakes, but I couldnt just do them forever cuz I also had to complete the target credits as well. \n\nThis pattern went on till  today, where now I barely have a CGPA of 3.2 with 94 credits completed (out of 130) so far. Im still struggling a lot, and day by day Im realizing more &amp; more that CSE was never ever my cup of tea to begin with. Over trusting my receptive ability, I never shouldve taken a subject I had very basic knowledge and little to no interest.\n\nIve been lying to my parents about my CGPA, under tremendous pressure. Each gossip of my parents' so-and so relative or friend achieving this, or that, earning this-that,  feel like ruthless stabbings in my body. Seeing even most of the low ranking students in my school days having successful careers, high profile jobs, etc while Im still an Undergrad stud who's graduation is due and with no skills relevant to my Major.\n\nSince childhood my parents did their level best for me, so I could have a good life. But I feel like (no I AM) a failure who has spilled water over their bare-minimum expection. I feel like a total loser. They do love me unconditionally, but I can't see my father eye to eye, nor stay with him for much time in the same room out of sheer shame,guilt coming inside of me.\n\nI have lowkey suicidial thoughts, but fearing Allah I'll never do it. If you guys think that I've been ranting or  complaining,  then I apologize and seek your suggestions to improve myself.",

In my opinion, due to BNP having two factions now, Mirza Fakrul and Tarique Zia, they will keep BNP happy by just giving Fakrul and a few of their top candidates, seats in the parliament. However, Jamaat will win the majority and there will be huge bloodshed i’m sure after the results in the coming months. Just as Awami League did to them, they will stop AL from entering the elections. I personally don’t care about politics but I just never wanted them to come into power. No matter the act they do now before the elections, we all know how difficult they will make the lives of women especially, artists and general free minded people. \n\nYunus is in cahoots with them and Jamaat is already effectively running this interim goverment behind the scenes, will do the same as AL had done in previous elections but more smartly and win the upcoming elections through blatant rigging. I can’t believe a party who opposed Bangladesh’s independence and didn’t want this country might now be in power over it and Gen Z is letting this happen primarily. \n\n\n\n",

        "body": "A bit of background. I live abroad, and have been trying to give back to my country for years by hiring folks from the desh. I have given up finding good talent. I always pay market price or higher and honestly Bangladeshis in the workplace suck, at pretty much everything. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. They talk a big game and then under deliver. Before they get the role they are all like \"bhaiya of course, I can do it\". Afterwards, they under deliver, under promise, and most importantly under perform\n2. Bangladeshis are entitled and lazy. The hard work mojo just doesn't exist, especially if you went to an English medium school and went to somewhere like NSU, IUB, etc. I get that you paid a lot for your degree, but your degree doesn't mean shit. You have to do the job that has been asked of you, period! Don't like what I have to say, IDGAF.\n3. More often than not, their English sucks.\n4. Even if their English is good, their overall comms skills sucks to the nth level. Here are a few excuses I've heard when missing deadlines, meetings, etc:\n\n**Most common:** \"bhaiya, I'm stuck in traffic\" No shit dipshit, plan around the traffic, you know Dhaka traffic sucks every day.\n\n**More common:** \"My mother was sick, which is why I couldn't pick up the phone\" I'm not gonna believe that 3 times in the same month, sorry.\n\n**Kinda common:** \"Exam chilo\" I understand you have an exam, but then don't take on a job you can't do if your studies come first.\n\n5. Asking them to stay on top of things consistently is like pulling teeth. Is it really that hard to do you job, everyday for 8 hours? I mean folks everywhere else can do it.\n\nIf you're not one of these things and looking for a role with me, reach out, but if you do these things, then please don't bother going anywhere to work. You're doing that org a disservice. These are basics of professionalism and if you were anywhere in US, Canada, or UK, you'd be fired for any of these flaws. There is a HUGE reason why Filipinos and Indians take jobs from us, and it's because Bangladeshis suck at the basics.\n\nContext: I'm hiring a video editor with animation experience who can work 8 hours a day and when done with the videos schedule social media posts. Not a hard job. But takes dedicated effort and time to do well. Please don't reach out if you don't fit that criteria\n\nUPDATE: 31 people reached out to me asking for a job after reading this post. Only three of them reached out after reading the WHOLE post and actually had some of the experience I was asking for. Most just reached out asking for what the role was and what the pay was. One even reached out desperately asking for money. If 28 out of 31 people didn't even read what I need, how can I expect good talent from Bangladesh if you don't even pay attention to the details? ",

But i am still confused whether should i continue my study here or move abroad for undergraduate. Our financial condition is stable so the budget won't be an issue if it's not too much. Or should i study undergad here at private like nsu brac or iut then move to abroad for masters. I would like to join the engineering/IT sector\n\n\nEdit: I have made my decision. I will study bachelors in abroad, preferably Australia or uk, for now, and immediately after graduation, I will try my best to apply for a stable job in it related sector like Ai/machine learning/data science etc. Thanks for all the advice.

I had to spend hours at the hospital and then take care of the house. My admission phase has started for the last 20 days. In these 20 days, there hasn’t been a single day that I have studied for 8 hours. You may ask why this amount of time. Because I used to study for these many hours while I was in college, and fair to say I gave my HSC with ease and no worry. I really want to study at Dhaka University, but my parents gave me hundreds of responsibilities to take care of. While doing so many things, I have very little time to study. I have way too many classes to finish (recorded ones). I have only gone to two offline classes and given none of the weekly exams. Today was my 2nd weekly exam. I had started to study for my admission since I started my college. I have ADHD — the proper one for which you need to take medication. I take those and function somewhat properly, but now, with so many things to tackle, the meds are even falling short. Please tell me what to do. I am already watching recorded classes at 2x speed, but still there is too much to finish. I even put away my phone. I don't use it at all. What should I do? Please don't just comment \"study.\" I know that and am doing my best, but I feel hopeless. I never had backlogs, so having backlogs for the first time makes me question my whole existence. My parents aren't pushing me or anything. They told me that \"we know that we have given you too many responsibilities. So, if you want to study at a private university, you can. We have no issues.\" But I really want to study at Dhaka University. I have always dreamed of studying at Dhaka University. I will be appearing for B unit. ",

        "body": "Hi, hopefully you all are doing well. I completed HSC and stepped into the admission rat race. Even though I wanted to pursue engineering since I was a kid, the current landscape of engineering in Bangladesh is not that healthy, and I can't go abroad due to family issues. And don't want to end up lining up for BCS, so I decided to prep for IBA with A-Unit as a backup. But the current issue I face is the ability to stay motivated. I have joined a bhaiya's personal batch (offline), and he is a very good teacher, and I understand his lectures very well. The problem lies with the students themselves. Most of them have prepped for IBA since the dawn of their college life, whereas I didn't. So all the lectures basically turn into these awkward 2-hour segments in my day where I stay silent because I am still learning and trying to understand my questions whereas my peers answer before bhaiya finishes reading the question. Which makes me feel like an absolute dummy, on the other hand, they chit-chat about how they finished Wordsmart 2 times and already finished mentors' Qbank, and are just revising it. In all the free mocks, they score 60-70%+ while I barely cross the passing bar. This cycle makes me very anxious about my prep for the upcoming months and makes me second-guess all the time. If it were DU, DU, BCKRUET, I wouldn't panic as much because there are plenty of seats. But competing for 120 seats while my peer group of only 10 people is miles ahead makes me think that other aspirants have already made it inside IBA. So what am I asking from bhaiyas and apus is whether I should back off or continue my prep among these titans who have already finished the \"syllabus\".",

They won because our generation, DU's voter demographic, has largely **only seen Shibir's struggles and the injustice against them**, not their failures. *The debt of injustice must be paid.* They are the alt that our generation is looking for. A similar phenomenon of alt-right resurgence is quite commonplace across the world.   \n  \n3) I understand your fears and I have them too. **But as long as democracy works**, it does not matter who is in power. **If they try to impede on your rights, RESIST**. Resist and fight for every inch. And if they don't, accept that they are the leaders with public mandate. Everybody wins if they keep their promises.   \n  \n4) The Left in this country is systematically broken. They can't financially keep up with the outrageous funds that the right has. And they lack organizational skills to a large extent. **The fact that Megh da won almost 5k votes even after his panel having Emi as the VP candidate is genuinely astounding and a testament to his personal capacity.** But without a proper organization, that will never be enough.   \n  \n5) **Move beyond just the Shadik Kayem Pakistani rhetoric. No one cares if he is. Message on what to vote for, don't lecture on what to vote against.** Broaden the umbrella. **Educate people outside the bubble, and not demean**. Am I sad that a central landmark of our history and heritage will bear the name of Jamaat as it's leaders? For sure. **But only its name, not its ideals**. At least not yet.",

Just look at Chhatrodol, men in their 30s acting like goons, grabbing power and assets, terrorizing students.\n\nIf Sadiq Kayem can actually deliver more for DU students than these motorbike-wielding thugs, why bash him solely for being tied to Shibir?\n\nWe need to think critically: if we reject Jamaat completely despite any good works, shouldn’t we also reject BAL and BNP for their decades of corruption, abuse of power, and exploitation under the “pro-71” banner?\n\nOf course, there were other candidates too, but my point is, we should realize that political parties commodify ’71 and use it as a shield to justify their sheer incompetence and control over people. We shouldn’t let that happen.\n\nAt the end of the day, should leadership not be about clean image and competence, rather than being stuck with the same corrupt parties just because they wear the \"pro-71\" label?\n\n**NB:** I am not a Jamati, guys.

I’ve reviewed the information on NSU’s website regarding merit-based and need-based waivers, but I still find parts of the process unclear in practice.\n\nI’m hoping to hear from students who have been in a similar position, who didn’t get an admission-test waiver but applied after their first semester. How did you approach the application, which category did you choose, and what supporting documents did FAO value most? How realistic is a 50% waiver for someone in my situation? Any practical advice on strengthening the application would be deeply appreciated.I’d love to learn from your experiences so I can approach this properly and not miss any crucial steps. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to share their journey.",

After taking some time to reflect, I believe that Economics aligns much better with my academic strengths and personal interests.\n\nI am considering applying for a fresh start as a completely new student in the Economics department at BRAC University, without any credit transfer from my previous courses. However, I am uncertain about the university’s policy regarding re-admission after academic dismissal and whether it is realistically possible to get accepted under these circumstances.\n\nMy CGPA and completed credits are quite low, which limits my options for credit transfer to other institutions. Moreover, BRAC University remains the most convenient choice for me geographically and academically.\n\nIf anyone has experience or insights about reapplying to BRAC after dismissal or successfully changing departments in a similar situation, I would greatly appreciate your advice. Additionally, if a formal appeal or request letter is necessary, I am open to guidance on how best to approach this.\n\nThank you in advance for your support!",

My beloved husband is jobless, apparently applying for jobs seems exhausting and frustrating to him. In this situation, suffocating is an understatement. \n\nI got married partly to hide my academic failures from my parents and keep extended family drama at bay. Plot twist: it’s not working for my sanity.\n\nEverytime I visit my parents in Chittagong it's a goddamn fleeting moment of bliss. Freedom, food, love, and zero marital tension. Coming back to Dhaka? Nightmare mode activated.\n\n\nHere's the kicker. I can’t just leave him yet, because my parents can’t fund my accommodation and retakes (part of the reason I got married in a rush because my parents couldn't maintain a rented flat in Dhaka anymore solely for MY studies). On top of everything else, they’ve already spent big on the Chittagong house. Living in resident halls isn't an option because well, y'all know how shitty DU halls can be. Basically, I’m trapped like a Sims character with zero autonomy.\n\nRight now I got the pressure of clearing retakes and the general “how do I survive this zero-privacy household without losing my mind?” energy drain.\n\nSo good people (and non-judgemental), I need advice:\n\nHow do I survive mentally in this married life turned hell for the next couple months?\n\nHow do I sneak in a short Chittagong vacay for weeks without my only tuition gig freaking out?

        "body": "I'm an SSC 2025 graduate with a science background (English Version) and also an aspiring psychologist. My plan after HSC is to attend DU A Unit or any public university. I might try for abroad to pursue my undergraduate studies, even if that’s not my primary goal. I definitely want to complete my higher studies abroad. \n\nI’m very interested in psychology, so much so that I’ve already started studying the basics from free resources, investing more time and energy into that than in my HSC syllabus. That’s actually the main issue. My parents keep telling me to take Arts or Commerce for HSC since those have shorter syllabi compared to Science, and my career aspirations aren’t related to Science anyway.\n\nI was determined to stay in Science despite the struggle, partly because it feels more practical to me, but also because I want to prove to myself that I can do well in Science. I scored a GPA of 4.67 in SSC, and if I switch to Commerce or Arts and get a higher GPA in HSC, I’d always feel like I took the easier route.\n\nRecently, though, a relative suggested the possibility of doing A Levels instead of HSC, especially because Psychology is an actual subject there and it could make overseas education easier. And also because I don't have to  attend an institution for that, private registrations are a thing.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

Is it really worth sticking with CSE for jobs and higher studies in this climate?

Another common path I see is the \"CSE undergrad + MBA\" combo.\n\nSo, what do you think?  \n  \nIs switching to Law after CSE even a practical idea?  \nOr, Would doing an MBA make more sense?  \nOr, should I just tell myself, *“push through the pain, giving up hurts more,”* and stick with CSE for a Master’s &amp; career afterward ?\n\nAny advice or insights, especially from people who’ve been through similar decisions or seniors, would mean a lot.",

        "body": "We choose our universities based on bragging rights.\n\nWell to be fair, our parents kinda drill that idea into our head, that getting chosen as one of the very best is all that matters, not passion, nor the job field- current or future.\n\nHence after HSC, the best of the best prepares for BUET or medical colleges. Some of them have the sharpest analytical minds, while others follow a strict schedule to grind through the admission/ undergraduate period.\n\nAfter that, it's time to pick up another bragging right, and things get weird this time.\n\nThe bragging right from getting into a medical college transfers well into bragging about being a doctor. Because hospital visits are pretty common, and don't we all love to have a relative whom we can pester at the mildest of inconveniences? Having a much more direct impact in our lives rightfully placed doctors as one of the most respected professions in our current society.\n\nEngineers however, aren't that lucky in this regard. I believe most people imagine engineers as a guy surrounded by tools and trinkets, hammering away at some piece of technology and the closest thing to that in real life are....mechanics.\n\nPeople just love showing off their technical skills to us engineering students. Like yah dude, I just saw you fix that thing, good for you. Not really what they are teaching over there though.\n\nIf you ask people about engineering as a job, most would think of civil engineers in government, or maybe architects. Engineering as a job isn't that much of a bragging right here. R&amp;D field is lagging way behind. This limited opportunity drives most of the fresh graduates to pursue a life abroad, or to sit in BCS for other fields.\n\n'Engineer' is a barely protected class too. People who barely passed SSC can do a diploma in engineering and then complete evening course to call themselves engineers. They are also hogging all the 10th grade sub-assistant engineer posts. then they block the recruitment of BSc engineers in 9th grade, so that they themselves can takeover those posts as well.\n\nNo wonder people barely give any fuck about engineers",

I remember walking past Jamuna Future Park once when I saw two teenage girls maybe 13 or 14wearing beautiful sarees. A group of 5 or 6 men started mocking them, calling them names like 'Shahbagi' and 'm*g*\". The girls looked visibly scared. I was alone and didn’t know what to do I still feel bad and guilty for not stepping in.\n\nI used to think this kind of harassment was limited to social media, but now I see it happening right in front of us. Seeing this old photo today reminded me how much more judgmental we've become. Imagine, in the 1950s, when women had far fewer rights, they still walked confidently in sarees without this kind of public ridicule at least that’s what my grandmother tells me. And now, in 2025, in Bangladesh, this is where we are.\n\nSource- https://www.facebook.com/share/p/18uYeBNBuR/\n",

Belongs to outside of dhaka. \n\nmy family is financially quite stable but now i want to earn for myself on my own.Many of you can suggest me TUITION but i kind of dislike this profession. Look , my maternal brother is a tuition teacher , my junior is a teacher , my 1/2/3/4/5/6 year seniors are also teacher. This profession is crowded and the BHAIYA term just killed it. Specially I treat it as a kind of betrayal with the student from me if i enter this profession. Because of the type of presentation and content delivery i expect / received from my teachers, can never be delivered by me. It just became a trend now for quick money 💰\nপরের মাথায় কাঁঠাল ভেঙে খাওয়া\n\nIt's clear i am not made for it. My question is how can i cash my brain in other way?\n\n I am learning C currently. Would try competitive programming then , may then switch to AI or Machine Learning or Data Scientist. I also have interest in Game Development and ‍Cyber Security. Blockchain development, website backend development, API engineering are also some good options maybe.\n\nMy artistic sense is next to 0 , That scares me into going into game development.\n\nBesides, the rest of what I mentioned are all long-term plans.Now I don't understand which of them should I take forward or how many can I take forward together or should I take only one?Are there any skills among these that can be learned quickly and earned, or are there any other skills that are related to these and will help me to earn quickly ? Which of these skills will be most useful for the future? If i learn any of these skills, how soon will i be able to reach a 6-figure monthly salary?",

I was looking through some universities and I really liked BRAC and AIUB however I am not eligible to apply to them as I have not completed A2 level exams.  I did however, complete my GCSE and AS levels. Which is how it usually works here in the middle east. \n\nPursuing A2 was optional in my school but it’s too late for me to start it and I already took a gap year so I need to start university as soon as I can. Is there any possible way I can enter those universities without my A levels? (Can I do a foundation year instead of doing A2 levels?) The universities aren’t replying quickly so i’m asking you guys.\n",

        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m an engineering aspirant, but I haven’t gotten chance into a public university yet. I’m considering going to a private one—most likely AUST. I know there’s a lot of debate about public vs. private institutions, especially in engineering, so I wanted to hear from alumni who’ve already entered the job market.\n\nDoes the university name really make a difference in hiring, or do skills and projects matter more? I’ve already delved deep into computer science as a hooby (I can code, have a few projects up on github, have good skills in digital electronics, fair enough Linux skills, have clear enough concept about system architecture, etc. ) and feel confident that I can outgrow my peers through skill development. But I’m wondering if hiring managers still prioritize public grads, even if private students have stronger skills.\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who has experienced this firsthand. Did attending a private university hold you back in any way? Or did your skills and experience outweigh the university name?\n\nIt is a shame that people like me who are actually passionate about the trade are left out by our stupid education system and guys with zero idea about how a computer works are getting into CSE just for the hypes. The admission process should infact be like how Ivy League schools do, accounting the applicants dedication and passion.\n\nAnyway, thanks in advance! ",

I have visa credit cards issued from USA which I can use internationally. I will use cash for a small purchases, but the wifey might want to do some major shopping such as clothes and jewelry so I might be looking at doing purchase transactions of 10,000+ taka and if she decides to do jewelry shopping , then we might be looking at a few lak taka. I don’t want to be carrying that much money and/or convert that much money from dollar to Taka since I’m not sure how much shopping I’ll be doing. So I was wondering do most stores in shopping places like Jamuna future park, etc accept credit cards. I assume they would, and if they do, do they usually charge a transaction fee? In USA, most transactions with credit card they don’t charge a transaction fee. But sometimes small stores charge 2 to 3% fees. So I was wondering if that is something I would have to account for.\n\nThank you in advance for the help.",

As a result of the automatic conversion, I got an F. Thus, a domino effect of psychological and academic pressure started building up and in the 2nd sem, I was already in probation.\n\nFast forward to mid, I got D grades in most of the subjects, F in one subject again. What should I do in this situation..? I'm mentally devastated. One part of my psyche wants to drop out, another part wants to keep trying. But there's no point trying if I get a bad CG. Even worse, if I can't bounce back, I will get terminated and that will be the worst situation for me. I will have to get bullied by my own family(uncle, aunt, cousins). As my father is not alive anymore, no one will have my back. My elder brother is an addict. My mother put every hope on me. Just a few minutes ago she again reminded me how much money she's paying for me. My entire existence will become pointless again.\nI didn't choose CSE, they forced this subject on me. I got chance in the arch dep, but they didn't let me pursue my dream and passion for creativity just for the promising money and job opportunities they dream of. I was a jewel student of the family when my father was alive. After his death, the nonstopping problems keep ruining my life without giving me any break. I can't focus on my studies this way. I was going with the flow but now it's getting too hard for me to hold on. And I'm too afraid of being misjudged.\n\nShould I just drop out and fill out a form for HONs(in English) in national? Or should I keep enduring..? What can I do in this situation..!?\n\nAnd if I should drop out, please add a logical suggestion for what I should do after dropping CSE.\n\nThank you",

        "body": "  \n\nIn recent past private universities in Bangladesh used to be a place where one could get good environment, faculties and culture such as no student/teacher politics, no session jam etc. However, as step to maximize profit private universities has increased the students. Top private universities such as NSU, BRACU, AIUB has enrolls 400-500 students in each year since covid. In my opinion this gargantuan number of students brings the average quality of students down as well as puts heavy pressure on infrastructure of private universities. I admit that public universities are nowhere near private universities in terms providing good environment and faculties to their students but I have to give them credit where its due. Admission process in public universities is far more rigorous and as a result they get the more academically motivated cohort. Its high time private universities pay attention to admission process rather than treating students as cash cow.",

        "body": "# 1. BIG PICTURE:\n\n***Lifespring’s business strategies hint at a cult movement.***\n\n* **Phase 1:** Access insecure men through topics like Premature Ejaculation.\n* **Phase 2:** Access women through misogyny, via content like \"10 Qualities of an Ideal Wife\". Religious undertone ensures that your judgement is unchallenged.\n* **Phase 3:** Access parents through fearmongering e.g. “Is social media making children suicidal?”\n* **Phase 4:** Access children through parenting e.g. “How to raise a religious child”. By now, your initial audience is in their late 20s, and newer ones in early 20s.\n* **Phase 5:** Preach about relationships, marriage, divorce, and working women.\n* **Phase 6:** Preach your content through popular influencers, and go on the offence against anyone who speaks against you.\n* **Phase 7:** Infiltrate the education system. Target ed-techs, and workshops in educational institutions.\n\n...\n\n# 2. FRAUD PRACTICES:\n\n***Dr. Shusama Reza uses misleading professional titles.***\n\nShe comes across as a lovable, caring, learned, religious, and traditionally conservative woman, but markets herself as a “**psycho-sexologist**”, and a self proclaimed “**parenting life coach**\\*”\\*. From online content to offline  workshops you’ll find her everywhere  talking about parenting, teenage mental health, child psychology, developmental psychology,  relationships, marriage, etc.\n\n*But she’s actually a* ***dermatologist***\\*\\*, and recently got a degree in\\* ***sexual medicine***\\*. No amount of “advanced training” qualifies her to advise about sensitive topics like childhood development.\\*\n\n...\n\n***Yahia Amin isn't qualified to counsel clients.***\n\nHe carries the title of “**Lead Psychologist**” of Lifespring, and refers to his clients as “*patients*”.\n\n*Until Jan 2024, we knew him to be a* ***EEE*** *graduate from Ahsanullah University, who had done a conversion masters from the University of Derby, followed by MSc in* ***Organizational Psychology*** *from University of London. Even if this is true, he is* ***not*** *qualified to provide counselling &amp; therapy to clients.*\n\n*Newer information suggests that he neither completed his Bachelor's from AUST, nor did any conversation masters from University of Derby.*\n\n...\n\n# 3. SCAM WORKSHOPS/COURSES:\n\n*One of the biggest sources of income for Lifespring are their myriad workshops and courses, charging Tk 10,000 to 20,000+ to sell you anything from 3 day chamber visits for intern doctors, courses on parenting, stress management, “Emotional Healing”, etc.*\n\n***Lifespring’s most expensive course is falsely advertised, and certifies you for nothing.***\n\nTheir most expensive course is \"Clinical Mental Health\", a certificate program priced at a whopping **Tk 50,000** and seems to have a fully structured schedule and curriculum. It’s advertised as “*internationally recognized and affiliated with* *Mental Health America*”.\n\n**Which is a lie, MHA has no affiliates outside of America.**\n\n*To make matters worse, the certificate doesn’t certify you to do anything. For comparison, you can get yourself CBT certified by spending anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 BDT.*\n\n...\n\n# 4. ONLINE MISCONDUCT:\n\nThere are dozens of examples of Dr. Kushal making derogatory remarks from his business page.The nature of his online negativity include misogynist posts, scolding teenagers, shaming people about their skin color, IQ, personality, etc.\n\n*2 doctors had to file a* ***GD*** *against Dr. Kushal for calling them* ***islamophobes****, following which swarms of his followers continued to harass them for days.*\n\n...\n\n# 5. DISINFORMATION:\n\n*Lifespring has repeatedly distorted and misrepresented data in a way that shifts the blame away from parents and young men, while portraying women and younger generations as social problems.*\n\n**PERSONALITY DISORDERS:**\n\nDr. Kushal stated in a post that teenagers are unfairly arrogant and rude with their parents. According to him, “*people with personality disorders are rude and mean to their parents*”.\n\n*But the major cause behind personality disorders is* ***childhood abuse***.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SEXUAL HEALTH:**\n\nIn March 2022, Dr. Kushal published a series of Q&amp;A posts on sexual health, but the cases he discussed do not seem to represent a real clinical picture. The commonest sexual health concerns in any hospital or clinic are low libido, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, vaginismus, etc.\n\nThe cases highlighted instead were:\n\n* Adolescent women worrying if future husbands will accept their “**excessive sexual urges**”.\n* A young boy complaining that his girlfriend is a “**sex freak**”.\n* A middle-aged woman in an **extra-marital affair**.\n\nLifespring practically built their core audience on the common conditions mentioned above, and yet somehow not a single one of them showed up in Dr. Kushal’s Q&amp;A? What are the odds of someone in their late teens or early twenties worrying about having “too much sexual urge”, and actually visiting psychiatrists to reduce it? And of all people, what are the odds of them visiting Dr. Kushal???\n\n**The entire thing was fabricated to demonstrate something ‘wrong’ with our generation.**\n\n*Also, ‘hypersexuality’ isn’t a disorder. There’s no upper limit on how much sexual urge is “too much”.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SUICIDE DATA:**\n\nIn June 2022, Dr. Kushal wrote a huge post where he predicted that Gen - Z will see an increased rate of suicide in age 35 years. According to him, the leading causes will be “*faulty philosophies*”, “*reckless lifestyles*”, mid-life crisis, old age loneliness, “*multiple relationship trauma*”, and “*religious agnosticism*”.\n\nIn the same month, Lifespring hosted a public event in Chittagong, where they claimed that *social media* was responsible for suicides. In an interview by The Financial Express, Dr. Kushal claimed that social media leads to “*Imposter Syndrome*”, which then leads to suicide.\n\n**And he couldn’t be further from the truth.**\n\n*At present,* ***67.3%*** *of suicidal deaths occur between the age of* ***13-19*** *years, with the leading causes being conflict with parents, partner conflict, and academic stress. Females make up* ***65%****.*\n\n**And that should tell you a lot about who we should really blame.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**GENDER DIFFERENCES:**\n\nOn 3rd January 2024, Dr. Kushal uploaded a video from a public event where he made a number of statements. According to Lifespring’s research, males are:\n\n* 2 times more likely to seek professional help.\n* 2.5 times more prone to self-harm.\n* 2.6 times more likely to commit suicide.\n\n**None of these numbers match with local and global data.**\n\n*3.1% of Bangladeshi women sought professional help in 2020, as opposed to 1.7% of men, giving a male-female ratio in seeking help of* ***1:1.8***\\*. A 2021 study in Dhaka found that 16.3% of female and 8.2% male students reported self-harm, so the male-female ratio for self harm is\\* ***1:1.99***\\*.\\*\n\n*The male-female ratio of completed suicides were 2.7:1 in 2019, but after the Covid-19 pandemic more than* ***60%*** *of suicidal deaths have been consistently female.*\n\n**In other words, every single statistic is presented reversed.**\n\n...\n\n*Globally, research on help-seeking behavior across various countries consistently shows that women are more likely to seek professional help for mental health issues. Research on self-harm shows higher rates among women in some regions, while others show similar rates for both genders. Suicide demographics vary from country to country.*\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1.

        "title": "Tips for future foreign visitors to Bangladesh - my experience",
        "body": "Please put your fears aside and go visit!  \n\n\nI was in Dhaka last week for four days and want to share my experience / advice for anyone thinking of visiting or who may be on the fence. Overall, I had an amazing time in BD and was so pleasantly surprised by the people and the city itself. I'd heard and read a lot about Dhaka, mostly horror stories, which were in the end exaggerated. Maybe I got lucky, but I would go back in a heartbeat even with the noise, chaos and grime.\n\nMy tips:\n\n1. The visa process is... involved. I could have tried for a visa on arrival due to my nationality but didn't want to risk it so paid more and sent my passport to the BD embassy in my country. I had to provide a lot of documentation including a travel plan (word document with pictures and descriptions of what I wanted to visit). I was asked for an invitation letter but told them I don't know anyone there and was just coming for a tourist and was approved. \n2. Permits are needed to visit some sites. The Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban / National Parliament is one. I applied late and also due to circumstances on the ground couldn't get in. Apply well ahead of time if you need a permit. Hill Tracts is another place that you'll need one for.\n3. Transport - the traffic jams are real. Especially in the morning and afternoon. Uber is available and works fine but you can only pay in cash. Rickshaws are handy in Old Dhaka, I didn't take a CNG so can't comment but I was extremely grateful for the aircon of a car while I was there. Get your hotel to help if you need assistance getting around.\n4. Get a guide. I can't emphasise how much having a local guide helped me in exploring Dhaka. Even just getting around the city, negotiating transport, organising food - invaluable. Plus, they're knowledgeable (hopefully) about their city and country and can show you what their life is like. My guy was excellent and felt more like a friend by the end of the day.\n5. Safety - I never felt unsafe, though I'm quite a large guy and not a traditional target. I was warned about pickpockets by the locals so I just went out with minimal possessions. Using your phone out and about is fine, just be conscious of where you use it. People WILL stare at you. Especially in Old Dhaka, not so much in Banani / Gulshan. Just be friendly, have a good attitude and don't take it personally. Many people will have a conversation and ask where you're from if you're inclined to talk to them. I can't say what it's like for women but I'm quite sure you'll get much more unwanted attention. Dress conservatively. If you feel unsafe, ask a local for help - I don't think you can rely on the police and they were barely present anywhere. Have your embassy's contact details handy.\n6. Health - wear sunscreen. Take extra with you. Drink lots of water if you're sweating, which you will. I went in September and within minutes of stepping out of the car I would be dripping in sweat. Mosquitoes aren't a huge problem in Dhaka but Dengue is present in BD so have repellent just in case. I managed to avoid food poisoning altogether by not eating street food and sanitising my hands regularly. I still got to enjoy lots of nice cuisine this way. I had loperamide and oral rehydration solution with me at all times just in case.\n7. Communication - many people speak passable English. In Banani / Gulshan most storekeepers will speak it, all hotels will have English-speaking staff. People will be shy to speak it with you at first, so be nice and speak slowly. Free wifi was not abundant like I'd be used to in say Thailand, but is easy enough to find if needed. I didn't bother with a local SIM like I'd planned but if I was out in the city on my own I'd probably have it for directions. Offline Google translations with the camera function helps a lot.\n8. Airport - honestly, it's not great. Old and dysfunctional. No free wifi airside. Landside had it, go to the information booth past immigration to get them to set it up for you. There are food options available, but nothing like you're used to and it is expensive. I really recommend having a car booked to pick you up from the airport as the arrivals pickup area is wild. Everyone uses WhatsApp there so have your driver's number ready and just let them know you're there and to come get you. I got to the airport 2.5 hours before departure and had plenty of time. Airport officials might escort you past lines and expect a tip, don't feel obligated to pay (I wish I hadn't skipped the lines, when I realised later it wasn't normal I felt guilty -  just line up).\n9. Daytrips - Sonargoan is well worth a trip to visit Panam Nagar alone. The other sights are quite nice. It takes about 1.5-2h to get there by car. You'll see a lot of poverty on the outskirts of Dhaka, be prepared.\n10. Food - there are restaurants everywhere and if you pick a clean-looking one you should be OK. As mentioned, I avoided street food even though I badly wanted to try Pushka. Western options are few and far between and mostly upscale places in the richer neighbourhoods. Coffee culture doesn't really exist, so drink hot chai and eat peanuts.\n\nIt's really not this horribly inaccessible city that people like to frame it as, but it has potential to leave a bad taste in your mouth if you're not prepared. Spend the extra for a guide if you can and for a car if you're doing a day tour. The people were the nicest I've ever met and left me with a really positive feeling. I was sad to leave Dhaka and Bangladesh. I would definitely go back - be brave and give it a go!",

        "body": "So, my Poco x3 just crashed. I need to buy a phone.\n\nAfter surfing a lot of time on the web, I came across the USED phone at a low price part. Some big YouTubers like \"Samzone\" and other relatively small YouTubers are talking about the benefits and problems of buying a used phone. And actually, after some thinking, I think a used phone will give me some better benefits if I buy it with the budget that I have.\n\nI also came across some Shops that will sell smartphones with replacement and service warranties. Some of the most noticeable are,  \"Gadget n Gadget\", \"Smart Valley\", and \"Tnkle Gear\". \n\nTheir shops are mainly in Jamuna Future Park.\n\nSo, \n\n1. Do you think I should buy a used phone that they say are Internationally used phone? \n\n2. Do you have any experience with buying a used phone and using it?\n\n3.

        "body": "I know there are a lot of issues in our country, corruption, traffic jam, and unemployment just to name a few. But despite that, when I really think about it, there are also a lot of things that are good that I know living in a western country I wouldn't get.   \n\n\nHere is a list of things I am grateful for living in this country (Let me know in the comments whether you agree or disagree with me):  \n\n\n* The food: The wide variety of food we have (street fuchkas,  old dhaka food, biriyani, pitha, achar etc. ) I know I will neverrr get the taste anywhere else. My nana bari is in barisal and my nanu and relatives in barisal makes amazing pithas which I soo love. Not to mention all the other delicious food that you are gonna miss if you live abroad.\n* The people: We maybe a backbiting and gossiping nation, but there is a bond that we bengalis are able to make that you wouldn't really get anywhere else. I am a scholastican and the bond that we have as a whole batch I have never heard of that happening anywhere else (I have cousins in US, they dont have the same vibe) I also have this amazing bond with my university friends and business colleagues, which I often feel is lacking abroad. If you live in a western country you are more alone as its a hectic life there\n* Family &amp; Relatives: I know we all hate our relatives, but one thing I really love is when you have a big family, (my mom has 100+ first cousins from the paternal &amp; maternal sides) you tend to have amazing family reunions. I still remember when I was young when we went to Barisal for a family gathering involving a lot of my mom's cousins (my khala mamas) and their children we used to have a blast. You are gonna miss this out if you have been brought up abroad as it's just not the same.   \n\n\nI am also thankful for some things that the west has that our country doesn't:\n\n* We don't have young lunatics in our country that does mass shootouts in schools. We don't have guns, yes, but our society does not breed such lunatics cause if we had them they would bring knives to start killing their random classmates\n* Do you know that our society has much less in comparison to the USA? Serial killers and serial rapists. Yes, we do have murderers and rapists but those who are serial K / R are a different breed of their own. To date, I believe we have only had 3 serial killers in the last 30 years. Compare that with 175 serial killers in the USA in the last 30 years alone\n* Also in regards to sexual assault /rapes, in many ways, it's much lower than in the west. in the USA for example, an estimated 27% of college/university girls get sexually assaulted. That's 1 in every 4 university girls. If you studied in any reputed private university in BD (NSU, BRAC, AIUB, IUB, etc.) tell me how many girls do you know who have been sexually assaulted in university? I personally know none. That is a huge difference. And it just gets to show that in some ways it is much safer for girls in BD than say in the USA. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, despite high unemployment rate in our country and this dystopian notion that we can't do shit in this country and its better to move abroad, that's not entirely true. I personally know many people who made it big doing in business when they were literally 0 at some point (I am one of them as well). A few senior bhais I know are  literal millionaires today without 0 political and family backup whereas 12 years back they had nothing. This isn' one or two person in my field I know many who have become successful through their hard work.   \n\n\nSorry for the long post. You can of course agree to disagree with my view, but anyways happy victory day!",

        "body": "I started a mission to visit Bangladesh each year, I started saving up my cash and i went last year so i am going this year again. I love to travel and like to visit wild places or attractions. I am going back to Bangladesh again next month so some good places i can visit?\n\nLast year i visited these places and had tons of blast :D\n\n* [**Nilgiri Resort**](http://nilgiriresort.com/) - Would recommenced but one of the staff asked for tip during our last day. Not sure if its always but i think its sort not professional (tipped anyway).\n\n* [**Shuvolong Waterfalls**](http://www.rangamatitour.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ham-ham-waterfall-bangladesh.jpg) - On the way to Cox Bazaar. The place seemed to have lots of people that day, so i didn't enjoy much, but the scenery while traveling to the fall was awesome (especially going by a boat part).\n\n* I went to visit some tea bagan in Syhlet. I traveled by train [**(i actually made a small blog)**](http://safery.me/syhlet-bangladesh-trip-part-3/). The Syhlet trip was Fun and i also visited the border between Bangladesh and India (not sure about location, but it was in Syhlet divison). Probably the biggest mistake i made was traveling by Train. We wanted to get experience to travel BD in train (not A/C class) so booked 3rd class ticket. Since this is was after EID, none of us were prepared for the ride (since most of us never traveled by Train).. We literally gave away our seat so i would get fresh oxygen from the door.\n\n\nI still have not visited the wild side of [Sundarban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans). Possibly, i am not even sure how safe it is to go to these parks (assuming its government protected)\n\n\n**Plan Recommendation?**\n\n* [**Jatiyo Sangsad Bhaban**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatiyo_Sangsad_Bhaban) - Wanting to visit this place, but i don't want to look at the outside. Is there way to get a tour inside?\n\n* [**Novo Theatre**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangabandhu_Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman_Novo_Theatre) - Haven't been to this place since 2004. Possibly will go this year. I tried to go last year, but it was closed that day and i didn't have any other free day.\n\n\n* **Cox Bazar** - Didn't visit any place except for the beach. Tried some extremely spicy shrimp and had to take pills because it gave me food poisoning (not vendor fault, i wasn't prepared for the spice. He warned us too).\n\nAlso something interesting. I went to the Lawachara National Park in Mouvibazar. Going deep inside the park, we were literally told by a stranger not to go anymore deep, apparently prostitution business goes on. And they would find it as threat since we are a large group. Apparently, they are controlled by local gang.",

(workbooks, practice files, online resources, etc.)\n* Do they offer continuous support throughout the training period? Can I reach out to instructors between classes if I get stuck?\n* How long does it typically take to complete the certification track?\n* What's the approximate cost range?\n\nI want to make sure I'm investing in a center that provides solid, practical training with proper instructor support.

She just finished her HSC exams yesterday, so she’s a fresh candidate.\n\nI need some guidance on a few things:\n\n1. When do these universities start their admission process for fresh HSC graduates?\n2. Does she need to take any admission tests, and how tough are they? Any tips or resources would be appreciated.\n3. I work a job and can pay her tuition monthly, but I don’t have the total amount saved. For example, if a BBA (4 years) costs around 10 lakhs total, that’s roughly 20k per month. I’m looking for actual numbers for Brac, NSU, and EWU so I can budget.\n\nIf anyone here is currently studying in these universities or just graduated, your input would be super helpful.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Logically, BRAC has the better reputation, brand value, and future opportunities, but I’ve heard their EEE faculty isn't that great and maintaining a high CGPA can be really tough. I live in Dhanmondi 10/A, so BRAC is also more convenient for commuting. On the other hand, most people I’ve talked to say AIUB has the stronger EEE department, a better alumni network, and a more manageable grading system, even though the commute is longer. I want to keep both doors open for the future: getting a good job in Bangladesh and also applying for a full/max funded master's abroad. The thing is, I feel emotionally drawn to BRAC because of its campus and brand value, but I’m not sure if it’s truly the right fit for me. I do feel confident that I can manage AIUB even if things get tough, but with BRAC, it feels more uncertain. I might grow and become a better version of myself, or I might struggle because of the academic pressure and faculty issues. At the same time, if I choose AIUB, I wonder if I’ll regret not choosing BRAC simply out of fear. I’m torn between going for something that could be high reward but also risky, or choosing something that feels more balanced and stable. Would really appreciate any insights from current or former students.\n",

Only CSE and EEE are the options I shall pursue. \nMy brother couldn’t get into any public and graduated in EEE from AUST and currently doing PHD in USA. \nHe is considered the golden child and to be honest I'm proud of him as my brother and he is the only elder in my family who will understand why I want to pursue ME. But If I don’t get a seat in public he won't the one paying my tution. It will be my parents and thus they will choose the path I follow and I don’t blame them it is the society and the surrounding that has made their perspective like this.\n\nComing back to the topic, So the only way I'm currently seeing to pursue ME is getting chance into a public. Specially BUET or CUET. so give this chotobhai some advice on how to crack these Universities get my desired subject. ",

        "title": "Shadows of Shyamoli",
        "body": "There’s something about Shyamoli late at night that feels different. It’s not as flashy as Gulshan or as serene as Hatirjheel, but it has this raw, unpolished charm. The narrow streets, the street vendors, the faint glow of neon signs—it’s like the city doesn’t try too hard to impress you here. That’s why I found myself there one Friday night, wandering aimlessly after a long day.\n\nI wasn’t planning on meeting anyone. Truth be told, I just wanted to grab a quick kebab roll from my favorite roadside stall near the old cinema hall. But fate—or something like it—had other plans.\n\nShe was sitting alone on one of those rickety wooden benches outside the stall, her elbow propped up on the table, scrolling through her phone. She looked annoyed, tapping the screen aggressively like it owed her an explanation. She had a maroon shawl loosely wrapped around her shoulders, paired with a black salwar kameez. Her hair was tied up in a messy bun, and her glasses sat slightly askew on her nose. She didn’t look like someone who cared too much about appearances, but somehow, that only added to her charm.\n\nI didn’t think much of it at first. Girls like her usually have an aura that says, “Don’t bother me.” But then, the kebab stall owner—a familiar face—saw me and shouted, “Bhai, asho! Kebab ready hoye jacche!”\n\nShe looked up, startled by the noise, and our eyes met. For a second, I thought she was going to glare at me, but instead, she smiled. It wasn’t one of those big, cheerful smiles—more like a quiet acknowledgment, as if to say, “Well, here’s someone who doesn’t look completely terrible.”\n\nI walked over, ordered my usual, and found myself sitting at the bench across from her. It wasn’t intentional; it just happened.\n\n“You’re a regular here too?” she asked after a moment, her tone light but curious.\n\n“Guilty,” I replied, unwrapping my kebab roll. “Best kebabs in Shyamoli. What’s your excuse?”\n\nShe sighed, pushing her glasses up. “My friend ditched me. We were supposed to meet here before heading to a concert, but I guess plans changed.”\n\n“Concert?” I asked, intrigued.\n\n“Yeah, some indie band. Probably not your scene,” she said, smirking.\n\nI raised an eyebrow. “You’d be surprised. I’ve been known to dabble in the indie scene, as long as it’s not just guys in skinny jeans complaining about their exes.”\n\nShe laughed—a genuine, hearty laugh that caught me off guard. “Okay, maybe you’re not as basic as you look.”\n\nWe started talking, and before I knew it, my kebab roll was finished, and I hadn’t even noticed. Her name was Farha, and she worked as a junior architect at a small firm in Banani. She was witty, sarcastic, and had this dry humor that made every conversation feel like a game of verbal ping-pong.\n\nAt one point, she asked, “So, what’s your story? You don’t strike me as the Shyamoli kebab type. Gulshan? Banani? Maybe even Dhanmondi?”\n\nI shrugged. “I like places that don’t try too hard. And besides, the food here’s better.”\n\nShe nodded, seemingly satisfied with my answer.\n\nWe ended up spending hours just sitting there, talking about everything from Dhaka traffic to our most embarrassing childhood memories. She told me about the time she accidentally walked into a wedding wearing pajamas because she thought it was her cousin’s house. I told her about the time I got locked inside a school bathroom during a debate competition.\n\nIt wasn’t romantic in the traditional sense. There were no sparks flying, no sudden revelations. But there was something real about it—two strangers finding a moment of connection in a city that rarely slows down.\n\nWhen it was time to leave, she stood up and said, “Well, this was… surprisingly nice. I’m glad my friend ditched me.”\n\n“Same,” I said, smiling.\n\nAs she walked away, she turned back and added, “Oh, and if you’re ever at Shyamoli kebabs again, try the malai tikka. It’s better than the roll.”\n\nI haven’t been able to order anything else since.",

        "body": "It was one of those nights when Dhaka seemed quieter than usual, or maybe it was just my state of mind. Hatirjheel felt like the perfect escape, a place where the chaos of the city fades into the background, replaced by the calm reflection of lights on the water.\n\nArafon had bailed on me last minute, leaving me alone with a cup of tea from a street vendor and thoughts I wasn’t ready to face. As I sat on the edge of the walkway, staring out at the still water, she appeared out of nowhere, like she’d been dropped into the scene just to disrupt my solitude.\n\n“Don’t you think tea tastes better when you’re not brooding?” she said, smirking as she plopped down beside me without asking.\n\nI looked at her, confused. “Do I know you?”\n\n“Not yet,” she said, sipping from her own cup. “But you looked like someone who needed a distraction.”\n\nShe introduced herself with a name I’ve since forgotten, but her energy—restless, bold, and just the right amount of reckless—was unforgettable. She started talking about how Hatirjheel wasn’t really for peace, but for plotting. “Think about it,” she said. “Every big decision, every crazy idea, probably started with someone sitting here, staring at the water.”\n\nI laughed, partly because it was ridiculous and partly because she said it like it was the gospel truth.\n\nShe wasn’t like anyone I’d met before. Within minutes, she had me spilling about my bad week, my insecurities, and my dreams. And then, just as quickly, she’d switch the subject to herself, telling me about her own wild theories about life. She believed in things like “energy imprints” and how places like Hatirjheel absorbed emotions.\n\nThe thing about her was that she wasn’t entirely wrong. There was a kind of energy about that night, about her.\n\nBefore I knew it, we were walking around, talking about everything and nothing. At one point, she stopped by the bridge and leaned against the railing, looking out at the water. “You know,” she said, “life isn’t about finding answers. It’s about collecting moments.”\n\nI wanted to ask what she meant, but before I could, she looked at me and said, “You’ll figure it out. Eventually.”\n\nWe parted ways that night, and I never saw her again.\n\nHatirjheel isn’t the same for me now. Every time I visit, I catch myself looking around, wondering if she’s there, ready to disrupt my solitude once more.",

Buses, rickshaw (rarely), and walking the most. Sitting near parliament in some starry evening to drink tea, walk in Chandrima and Suhrawardy and and Ramna. And TSC, how can I forget? And Hatirjheel and umm Dhanmondi lake ofc, thats like my home, ngl. So, drinking tea, singing and walking, that's who I am. One part of me is very philosophical, like Himu. Another part of me is very technical, like Elliot Alderson. Oh yes, I am a CSE student and I am into cybersec as well. Even posting this post from a hacked wifi xD. Forget the hacker part, I just love exploring and drinking tea (like 7-8 cups per day &amp; only milk tea). And im very introvert when im not in philosophical mood. So yeah, got anyone similar minded here? Lets be friends and lets explore and drink tea together. Ciao. (Male, 20).",

        "title": "DU Math or Ahsanullah EEE?",
        "body": "***(even if you don't read this long rant, please answer the question given in the last paragraph)***\n\nI'm a student of HSC-24, and was a BUET aspirant until fate deemed it appropriate to kick my childhood dream to the curb. To say that I have an innate passion for engineering, however, would be slightly inaccurate, as my prior aspirations were based on the bipartisan nature of my parents' wishes (Daktar othoba Engineer hote hobe). And since Biology has always been a sore spot, I betrayed my father's profession by renouncing it completely and set my sights on the far peak that is BUET. My inner interests have always been core Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics, and research, so I dreamed of getting into MME of BUET, as that is the engineering subject that is the most theoretical and closest to core science. Needless to say, I won't get the chance of studying MME anytime soon. \n\nHaving thus been thwarted, my parents told me to set my sights on Ahsanullah University. They said if I got accepted into engineering subjects at DU, they'd allow me to study there, but after my BUET debacle, my father was of the opinion that I wouldn't even pass the DU exam. He was even skeptical about whether I'd be accepted at Ahsanullah, lol. Bear in mind, he didn't even allow me to give exams at CKRUET because 'Dhaka r baire toke jete dibona', and just because I failed at ONE exam, I became the failure and the root of all his problems. \n\nAnyways, as you probably guessed from the title, my father's fears were baseless and I came within 70-80th merit positions at Ahsanullah. \n\nI know it's not something to be very proud of, and honestly, the only satisfaction I felt at it is the fact that at least I could prove my father wrong and I didn't end up in a medical college even though that was my father's primary target. I got into EEE, and... I wasn't happy with the subject. Sure, it can be kinda interesting if I delve deep enough, and I'm focused on trying to avoid the academic plateau I'd arrived at during my college and admission days, because I want to end up as a university professor in my later years and I can't do that unless I have an exemplary CGPA. But.. I wasn't happy. Not with the subject, not with the campus, not with the reviews I read of various alumni. I don't work well under extreme pressure and I've heard that that's Ahsanullah's 'mulmontro'. I simply adjusted to my fate and tried to accept that this is where I have to survive. \n\nNow, let's come to DU. I honestly hadn't expected myself to pass either, because the exam had been a day after the BUET written exam and I was severely, severely demoralised. I gave the exam in an apathetic trance and walked out of there like the walking dead. I hadn't even studied the day before. I'd just lain on my bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering where I'd gone wrong and about the purpose of my useless existence. Afterwards, I even forgot to check the results of that exam and only did because my Facebook feed got flooded with tales of shining success and the crippling failure I had been all too familiar with.\n\nAlso as evinced by the title, I passed. My position was within the 2500-3000 range, and while it's also not something to be very proud of, I was proud of myself. My parents, however, were not impressed at all. Jaihok, analyzing past records of migration, me and my home tutors concluded that it's likely that I'll get into the Mathematics department. I felt a spark of that old dream returning, because I fell in love with Curzon Hall everytime I ventured there. I also enjoy Maths, perhaps not as much as Physics, but I can study Physics related subjects after graduating from Maths, right? Maths is the language of science.\n\nMy parents, however, are furious that I even dared to ask for this. They believe that Maths isn't worth it and that DU Maths is not a prestigious department. If I was looking for an office job, perhaps I would understand their concerns, but as I said before, I want to continue in academics and become a teacher. I also will not stay in Bangladesh after my undergrad, and I don't plan on returning before completing my PhD and gaining experience at foreign universities, if Allah keeps me alive til then.\n\nMaths porle I think a lot of research avenues will stay open for me. Besides, AUST honestly felt like a prison to me. I've been in prison all my life, not allowed to do anything or make any decisions. I don't want my undergrad years to be suffocating for me too. However, that is an emotional point, and not a logical one.\n\nSo, from a logical standpoint, do you guys think I should fight my parents to study at DU Maths? Or should I acquiesce to their demands and resign myself to AUST EEE?",

IUB was also my top choice but someone said it isn't really a good uni (not my words). My question is how hard are the admission tests for science department? I scoured the internet for previous years question papers but no luck cause private universities apparently don't release their question sheets. All I found are \"sample questions\".... which are (to put it bluntly) absolute baby tier. So I'm pretty sure those aren't indicative to what I'm actually gonna find on the actual test papers. If anyones a student in one of those universities then would love some information! Thanks in advance and have a great day! :D",

        "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m an engineering aspirant, but I haven’t gotten chance into a public university yet. I’m considering going to a private one—most likely AUST. I know there’s a lot of debate about public vs. private institutions, especially in engineering, so I wanted to hear from alumni who’ve already entered the job market.\n\nDoes the university name really make a difference in hiring, or do skills and projects matter more? I’ve already delved deep into computer science as a hooby (I can code, have a few projects up on github, have good skills in digital electronics, fair enough Linux skills, have clear enough concept about system architecture, etc. ) and feel confident that I can outgrow my peers through skill development. But I’m wondering if hiring managers still prioritize public grads, even if private students have stronger skills.\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who has experienced this firsthand. Did attending a private university hold you back in any way? Or did your skills and experience outweigh the university name?\n\nIt is a shame that people like me who are actually passionate about the trade are left out by our stupid education system and guys with zero idea about how a computer works are getting into CSE just for the hypes. The admission process should infact be like how Ivy League schools do, accounting the applicants dedication and passion.\n\nAnyway, thanks in advance! ",

Here’s a guide to help you navigate the chaos and come out with great finds:\n\n1. Understand Fabric Basics\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the different types of fabrics like cotton, wool, linen, and polyester. Knowing the texture, durability, and feel of each type will help you assess quality quickly.\n\nPro Tip: Watch a few YouTube videos about fabric identification and visit local stores to touch and feel different fabrics. Ask questions to build your knowledge.\n\n\n2. Learn to Spot Defects\n\nMany clothes sold here are factory rejects with minor flaws. Look closely for:\n\nStains or discoloration\n\nTears or holes\n\nMisaligned stitching or loose threads\nSpotting these issues gives you strong bargaining leverage. After a few trips, you’ll develop a keen eye for imperfections.\n\n\n3. Master the Market Dynamics\n\nThe markets opposite Dhaka College are a goldmine, but strategy is key:\n\nBrowse Without Obvious Interest: If you find something you like, don’t let the seller know immediately. Act casual—showing too much interest can drive up the price.\n\nWalk Away as a Tactic: If negotiations don’t go your way, walk away. Sellers often call you back with a better deal.\n\n\n4. Dig Through the Piles\n\nSome of the best finds are buried in chaotic heaps. Patience is your ally—digging through these piles can uncover hidden gems at unbelievable prices.\n\n5. Shop Smart at the Stalls\n\nSet a Price Ceiling: Never pay more than 500 BDT for a shirt unless it’s exceptional quality.\n\nBargain with Grace: Treat bargaining like a friendly game. Smile, stay polite, and avoid being overly aggressive. Sellers are more likely to offer good deals when approached with respect.\n\n\n6. Handle Seller Attitudes with Patience\n\nIn places like New Market, some sellers might grumble or complain even if they agree to a low price. It’s part of the experience. If you can tolerate the occasional rant, you’ll still walk away with a great deal.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBargaining is both an art and a skill—it takes time to master. With patience, observation, and practice, you can consistently find high-quality clothes at unbeatable prices. Good luck and happy hunting!\n\n",

        "body": "So I am very fascinated about education. The other day me and my friend were having a conversation about 7 colleges of Dhaka. She mentioned the fact that at-least 85% students of these colleges are not even qualified to be a student. She also added that they are nowhere near to students of IBA,DU, BUET or NSU,BRAC,IUB in-terms of quality. However, I disagreed her whole argument. I feel like they are just students who might not have the quality to study at government universities but they are certainly good enough for private. They just did not have that financial strength to study at NSU BRAC or other universities. \nShe laughed me off and said she they have pretty low mind set. She also mentioned she and her friend they both were harassed few times and the harassments were done by students of Dhaka College right beside Dhaka College. They even threatened my friend to make her their “toy” if she made any noise about it. \n\nToday Titumir College students harassing normal public really made me think. \n\nWhat is your opinion about these?",

Vegetable, fish, and essential goods traders were seen setting up their stalls from the morning.\n\nIn various areas, the presence of people on the streets was much lower than usual.\n\nThe number of vehicles on the roads was minimal. Apart from media vehicles, ambulances, or law enforcement vehicles, there were hardly any other vehicles. There were no CNG-powered auto-rickshaws on the streets.\n\nHowever, rickshaws were seen operating in all areas.\n\nFrom the morning, no processions or gatherings were seen in areas such as Dhanmondi, Mohammadpur, Mirpur, Paltan, Rajarbagh, Moghbazar, Hatirjheel, and Badda.\n\nHowever, BBC reporters saw protesters gathered at one place near the Khilgaon Railgate beside Rampura, blocking the road. Many protesters were seen with sticks and rods at that time.\n\nSigns of previous day’s violence were visible on the streets in various places, including Dhanmondi and Mohammadpur. Bricks were scattered on the roads, and broken rods from road dividers were everywhere.\n\nBurnt vehicle wreckage was seen on roads in different parts of Mohammadpur, Rampura, and Mohakhali.\n\nArmy personnel were seen stationed around Shahbagh, Mohakhali, and the Parliament building. Army members were seen checking the IDs of passengers in rickshaws and vehicles passing through these areas.\n\nBBC reporters observed army checkpoints in places like Mirpur 10 roundabout, Manik Mia Avenue, and the road in front of Shaheen College. They were stopping all vehicles for verification.\n\nThere was a curfew break from 12 PM to 2 PM. The curfew resumed afterward and will continue until 10 AM on Sunday.",

I decided to go there. \nThis post is a follow up on my experience. \n\n- Visa on arrival\nWhen I arrived at the airport the first thing I noticed was that it was a pretty old airport. I followed the signs and eventually I saw a visa on arrival. First I had to pay 51 US dollars, I don’t know why but they gave me 100 taka back. You have to pay at the Sonali bank next to the visa on arrival counter. They gave me a paper which I gave to the officer. I handed my required printed documents (hotel booking and return ticket). The officer asked me a few questions and he decided to give me a visa for 15 days. The overall process was not too bad for me and took around 15 minutes. \n\n- Traffic \nThe traffic in Dhaka was the worst I had ever experienced. No matter what time you are in the traffic there is always a traffic jam. From the airport to my hotel ( in Banani) the traffic was doable but when I decided to go to old Dhaka the traffic got crazy. Sometimes the traffic was just stuck and I would sit in a TukTuk between busses and the exhaust gasses. I read online that the average traffic speed is around 7 km/h, this is a little bit faster than walking. I’ve had many moments where I thought I might as well walk from here. \n\n- Old Dhaka\nOn the first day I decided to visit Old Dhaka and a few markets and areas around it. The driver dropped me off at Chawk bazaar and I walked around a bit. Eventually I walked to Lalbagh fort and visited the fort. This fort was not really interesting tbh. The streets and markets were very crowded but comparable to Old Dheli. Overal Old Dhaka was not extremely special but the experience was really raw. There are no tourist and no tourist traps, just the city and the locals doing their thing. The experience was very tiring, the constant honking, the busy streets, etc. \n\n- River and South Dhaka\nOn my second day I wanted to see the river and go on a boat. I went to the Sadarghat launch terminal. Here there was actually a guy who started talking to me, I knew he was a guide and wanted money but I liked it actually. \nThe guide showed me around the ships and we took a small boat to the other side. This is where they have a shipyard, I found this an extremely interesting experience. I grew up around boats and I love them. The guide showed me around the ships and the yard. People were making propellers in the street using molten steel. \n\nAfterwards the guide showed me around the south area, this was a poorer area but interesting to see. We visited markets and just walked around the area. I really enjoyed having a guide with me. I regret not having a guide in Old Dhaka, since there is no tourism it can be hard to find the good spots and having a guide does help. \n\n- Safety\nOverall I did not feel unsafe during my visit, I did notice that people were staring and asking where I am from. Overall the people were very friendly and interesting. I think it is safe to visit, however I would still recommend keeping an eye on the latest news regarding the protests, you really don’t wanna be in the city when there are protests. \n\n- Would I recommend\nThis is a hard question. Visiting Dhaka is a raw experience, there is hardly any tourism and you can have a good look into local life in the city. However visiting Dhaka is also more complex and more expensive. Since there is barely any tourism there are no hostels. \n \nI honestly think visiting a big city in India will be an easier and roughly same experience. New Delhi also has crazy traffic, local markets, busy streets, etc. India is a lot more touristy, this makes it easier: you have lots of hostels, things to do but also a lot of scammers. Visiting Dhaka is a raw experience that you will not forget.\n\n",

        "body": "Narrated by Saqib Rahman Sir of North South University:\n\nPosting this image as a reminder of a disturbing incident that changed the way Bangladesh approaches New Year’s celebrations. On New Year’s Eve in 2000, a young woman named Bandhan was assaulted at TSC by Chhatra League members who publicly stripped her. The event was so shocking that it was reported in newspapers like Ittefaq, capturing the horror of what should have been a night of celebration.\n\nSince then, New Year’s celebrations have come with heavy restrictions from authorities, turning these events into cautious gatherings. This serves as a reminder of the impact that unchecked actions and lack of accountability can have on society.",

        "body": "Can you explain why the student coordinators surrounding Dr. Yunus aren’t publicly expressing their ideologies? How can we know their plans for Bangladesh’s future? They want to change the constitution, but have they consulted the masses? I understand the forceful historical imposition of an Indian-hegemonic, Hindu-Bengali Renaissance culture through Mujib’s BKSAL (which was later enforced by Hasina through BAL), but is replacing it with an extreme form of another theology/ideology the solution? There’s talk of “inclusiveness”, yet have you seen Mahfuj Abdullah’s latest post? Why aren’t the coordinators clarifying their individual stances? Is this a communication failure?\n\nPublic uprisings involve the people, not just the students—17 crore citizens’ opinions matter. If all power is placed in the hands of a few people, we risk spiralling into authoritarianism again, right?\n\nI recently visited Dhaka University and saw not just posters and banners representing some very questionable organisations, but also their flags and leaflets. This is fine in terms of freedom of expression, but here’s an instance of a problem: Maulana Bhashani’s famous slogan, \"শুনো, ধর্ম আর দেশ মিলাইতে যায়ো না। পরে ফুলের নাম কী দিবা? ফাতেমা-চুরা?\" Now, I understand a particular religion is being singled out here. But in a majority-Muslim country, was Maulana Bhashani really wrong? \n\nLook at what’s been done to the artwork on the TSC walls. They’ve started a campaign to remove secularism under the guise of inclusiveness. Fine, I can accept that, but they’ve erased the word \"Fatema\" from the city’s artwork. I see this as an attack on democracy and freedom of expression. Are the student coordinators tolerating this? If yes, then how do they plan to implement \"inclusiveness\" in politics? Self conflicting?\n\nnb. This post is not only about the attack on the artwork and freedom of speech rather about the whole concept of Democracy under contentious circumstances.",

        "title": "The Shallow Analysis for a Tragic Accident",
        "body": "Recently, there was an incident on the Shahabag to TSC road at Dhaka University where a driver hit a motorbike and carried the passenger on the bumper for approximately 1km, ultimately causing the person (a woman) to fall under the car and die. As I frequently go that road by bike, this incident made me think about why it happened in the first place. Is there an underlying reason that we are not looking into, beyond blaming the car driver (a teacher)? I have a feeling that something is missing, and as I read the newspaper daily, I don't find any deeper analysis of this accident. It is rare in Bangladesh to have investigative journalism. Some of the investigative journalism we do have focuses on gangster actions against the police, but otherwise it is always shallow analysis and shallow blaming of an individual.\n\nThe problem with shallow analysis is that you can't find any consolation based on it. People usually forget the matter very soon. I am not a expert on this matter but from what I observed about this road and this accident, there are a few points worth considering:\n\n1. The road has several large holes and is not smooth.\n2. From the video, it appears that the car was very low in height, likely an old model Toyota. If it fell into a hole and the driver didn't notice, it could have jumped and moved quickly for a moment. From what I understand, the driver is likely a beginner or not very used to this type of road.\n3. There are too many rickshaws on this road. The driver could have gotten confused if a rickshaw turned quickly.\n\nWe can't be sure exactly why the initial collision happened, but these points are worth considering. If the initial collision didn't happen the way we see it, we don't know what happened.\n\nThe point I want to highlight is why there is no deeper analysis or study of this matter. I think the reason is that as a nation, we are not very good at analysis because our education system is not built around it. We are not encouraged to think deeply about a matter, so we skip over it. We value shallow matters like pori moni more because they are interesting and easy to write about. Additionally, an analytical mind is not something one is born with, it is learned from the environment, especially from teachers.",

I am a member of Calcutta Club and enjoyed coffee in Gulshan Club and Dhaka Club by virtue of the reciprocal arrangements. \n\nI hope more people from Kolkata come and enjoy this lovely city.

It was also really warm inside despite the AC, and after a few minutes, I started feeling dizzy and lightheaded.\n\nThen it hit me: I had skipped a proper breakfast this morning (just a cigarette and couple of junk food from streets). Combine that with the overcrowded train and heat, and my body just gave up. My vision blurred, my ears were ringing, and I knew I was seconds away from passing out. I actually thought this was going to be the end.\n\nI must have looked bad because people around me noticed. They made space and helped me sit down when one man stood up and gave me his seat. A woman handed me a bottle of water. Honestly, if it weren’t for those strangers, I don’t know what would have happened to me today.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I felt better, got off at my station, and made it home safely. Alhamdulillah I’m okay now.\n\nThere’s still so much kindness in this world.\n\nTo the strangers who helped me today, I'm sorry I didn’t get to thank you and I’ll probably never see you again, but may Allah be kind to you the way you were kind to me. ❤️",

I love eating good food, and I want to offer people the kind of food I would eat no shortcuts, no hesitation.  \n  \nMy goal is simple: tasty food, proper hygiene, and humble, respectful customer service.\n\nI'm drawn to fast food, especially pizza and burgers but not the generic ones you find on every corner. I want to create original recipes with unique sauces, bold flavors, and solid quality that stands out.   \nThink: “I’d happily eat this myself every day” kind of standard.\n\nLately, I’ve been considering TSC (Dhaka University area) as a potential spot. It's always buzzing with students and young crowds, and I feel like a quality, creative food cart could really work there.\n\nSo, I’d love to hear your thoughts:\n\n* Is TSC a good location for this kind of fast food cart?\n* Any ideas on what I could add to the menu besides pizza and burgers that would complement the vibe?\n* What modifications or unique selling points (USP) could I include to stand out?\n* What problems or challenges should I be aware of when starting out in a busy student area like TSC?\n\nThanks in advance for any feedback, advice, or experience you can share. I’m fully committed to making this real and doing it right. 🙏",

        "title": "10 Haunted Places in Dhaka – Fact or Folklore?",
        "body": "I’ve always been fascinated by the darker, mysterious side of our city. Over time, I've compiled some of the **most whispered-about urban legends and haunted spots in Dhaka**. Some are creepy, others tragic, and many are deeply rooted in local lore.\n\nHere are **10 urban legends of Dhaka** — read through and let me know if you've **seen, heard, or felt anything strange** at these places. And feel free to share **more local stories** we might’ve missed!\n\n**10. The White Lady of Airport Road**\n\n* **Legend:** Drivers report seeing a woman dressed in white suddenly appear on Airport Road (near Nikunja and Biman office).\n* **Effect:** Many say they swerved or crashed trying to avoid her. She's believed to be a ghost of a woman who died in an accident there.\n\n**9. Lalbagh Fort and Pori Bibi**\n\n* **Legend:** The ghost of **Pori Bibi**, the cherished daughter of Mughal Subahdar **Shaista Khan**, is said to wander the solemn grounds of **Lalbagh Fort**. A young noblewoman destined for royalty, she was engaged to **Prince Muhammad Azam Shah**, son of Emperor **Aurangzeb** and heir to the Mughal throne. Had she lived, Pori Bibi may have risen to the title of **Empress of India**. Her sudden death, occurring before the completion of the fort, brought construction to a halt and cast a long shadow of grief over her father and fiancé.\n* **Speculation:** Though historians point to illness or accident as the cause of her demise, the mystery surrounding Pori Bibi’s death has fueled ghost stories for centuries. Her tomb remains within the fort, and many visitors claim to feel a heavy presence near it—cold gusts, faint whispers, and a deep, unexplained sadness. Whether it's the weight of history or something more ethereal, Lalbagh Fort continues to evoke the sense that Pori Bibi’s story is unfinished, her spirit perhaps bound to the place where her dreams were buried.\n\n**8. Haunted Apartment in Banani DOHS**\n\n* **Legend:** An apartment in Old DOHS was reportedly built over an old graveyard.\n* **Paranormal Events:** Residents have claimed to hear footsteps, see ghostly figures, and experience electrical disturbances.\n\n**7. Shahidullah Hall Pond, Dhaka University**\n\n* **Legend:** Students talk about ghosts of drowned victims haunting the pond.\n* **Incidents:** Strange sounds and sightings late at night are commonly reported.\n\n**6. Haunted House in Dhanmondi (Road 27)**\n\n* **Legend:** An abandoned house near Dhanmondi Lake is said to be cursed.\n* **Stories:** Locals claim they've heard strange cries and seen lights flickering inside, though it’s been unoccupied for years.\n\n**5. The Ghost in Azimpur Graveyard**\n\n* **Legend:** Azimpur Graveyard, one of the oldest in Dhaka, is home to numerous ghost stories.\n* **Sightings:** Gravediggers and nearby residents report shadows moving between graves and whispers at night.\n\n**4. The Girl on the Rickshaw (Mohakhali Flyover)**\n\n* **Legend:** Late-night rickshaw pullers have told tales of picking up a quiet girl who vanishes mid-ride near the Mohakhali flyover.\n* **Theory:** She’s believed to be the ghost of a woman who died in a hit-and-run.\n\n**3. Karwan Bazar Train Ghost**\n\n* **Legend:** An invisible presence is said to walk along the tracks at night.\n* **Claim:** Railway workers sometimes hear footsteps or laughter, but find no one when they look around.\n\n**2. Bangabhaban Palace Ghost**\n\n* **Legend:** As the official residence of the President of Bangladesh, Bangabhaban is rich in history—and ghost tales.\n* **Whispers:** Guards have shared rumors of seeing a colonial-era British officer’s ghost wandering the grounds.\n\n**1. Haunted Rita-Mita House in Mirpur**\n\n* **Legend:** Known as the **\"Haunted House of Mirpur\"**, this residence at **House No. \\*\\*\\*, Road 9, Block C, Section 6** gained eerie notoriety in 2005. Locals whispered of strange behavior, flickering lights, and ghostly noises coming from inside. The house was occupied by two reclusive sisters—**Dr. Ainun Nahar Rita** and **Engineer Nurunnahar Mita**—who had isolated themselves from the outside world for years. Fear turned into horror when neighbors discovered the sisters had **secretly buried their deceased mother in the backyard at night**, an act many interpreted as part of some dark ritual or possession.\n* **Speculation:** The bizarre incident quickly drew media attention and intervention from human rights groups. When the truth emerged, it was revealed that both sisters were suffering from schizophrenia, a severe and untreated mental health condition. Their increasingly erratic behavior stemmed from years of psychological deterioration, not paranormal influence. However, despite the clinical explanation, the story of Rita and Mita continues to be told in hushed voices across Dhaka—blurring the line between mental illness and the supernatural, and solidifying the house’s place in urban legend.",
