Hamza nearly scored himself just before the break, while both teams played mainly for pride since neither remains in contention for the 2027 tournament.

        "body":"The government collapsed in July–August 2024 after a student-led protest because citizens demanded merit over quota. Sounds noble, right? Except the whole thing was hijacked from the very beginning.\n\nThose naïve, illiterate social-media activists and the “cool Dhaka kids” who wanted some good Instagram content ran to the streets without realizing a basic truth: BNP–Shibir gundas hijacked the movement on day one. They staged everything. They used those same cool Dhaka kids as puppets. They manipulated every moment of it.\n\nAnd nobody ever stopped to ask a single real question:\n\nWho are these NCP “student leaders”? What are their qualifications? What drove them to lead this protest? When did these uncles disguised as students actually graduate? What have they done with their lives besides student politics?\n\nThe same people who screamed about merit are now perfectly happy letting these criminals become the next representatives in government.\n\nI am not supporting one side over the other. I am simply asking everyone to think for once.\n\nDo you really want to live in a cave and pretend that:\n\nThe Awami League government falling automatically turned Bangladesh into a civilized, developed South Asian utopia under Dr. Yunus?\n\nBecause here is the reality:\n\nYunus is not making any key decisions. His cabinet is. And they were chosen based on quota, not medha.\n\nIn any functioning country, an interim government must be neutral, not tied to any political party. But our current administration is doing the exact opposite. Whenever NCP orders Yunus to do something, he complies out of fear.\n\nAnd honestly, this feels exactly like what the plan was all along.  \nPeople forget he formed Nagorik Shakti (Citizens’ Power) back in 2007.  \nConnect the dots.\n\nThis government is intentionally delaying elections while handing NCP an open license to operate. Meanwhile Nepal had a government collapse and their interim immediately declared election timelines… exactly what an interim is supposed to do.\n\nYunus is enjoying his new status and free private flights to new destinations on taxpayers’ money, while the Bangladeshi cool kids think being “politically conscious” means trash-talking a party that has already fled the country, or using fancy buzzwords to blame foreign nations instead of holding the current administration accountable.\n\nNow let us talk about the outcome.\n\nThere is no solid evidence that the original cause gained anything. It is a full-on shitshow.  \nThe trial was a shitshow because it means nothing.  \nThe world is literally laughing at Bangladesh.\n\nDeath sentencing people in absentia is a joke, but people ate it up and celebrated anyway.\n\nWhat did the interim actually change?\n\nThe economy is collapsing.  \nMurders, robbery, theft, rape statistics are skyrocketing.  \nThe garments industry is struggling with hundreds of factories shutting down.\n\nBut sure… the so-called “student leaders” are making slogans and people are cheering like everything is fine.\n\nAnd then there is the new trend online.\n\nPeople are making cool edits of Lutfor Zaman Babor, acting like he is some hero out of a Netflix series. Why is everyone blindfolded? or why the “student advisors” who magically appeared out of nowhere suddenly became the face of the movement. Not a single person questioned what medha qualified them to “advise” ministerial portfolios. But somehow they went from nobody to VIP overnight. Rags to riches, just like that.\n\nAnd then there is the sudden obsession with Tareq Zia, who has now become everyone’s eye candy. People act like reposting aesthetic edits of corrupt political bloodlines is activism.\n\nStudy history. Learn about their smuggling stories. Learn about JI.  \nLook at patterns.  \nYou are being emotionally manipulated by social media every single day.\n\nDo not let TikTok edits and Facebook reels generate your political opinions. Think for yourself. Stop idolizing netas who have done nothing for you.\n\nBlaming “the West” or “India” will not take Bangladesh anywhere.  \nBlaming outsiders is the easiest way to avoid looking in the mirror.\n\nEducate yourself.  \nLearn the facts.  \nStop being a pawn in someone else’s political game.",

So I’d prefer a place that’s relatively safer in terms of earthquakes. Also, with good medical facilities near by, as my parents are getting old and I don't want to risk anything.\n\nWhat do you think about Rajshahi? I really liked the city when I visited.

        "body":"I think you all know that the Interim Government has finalized the referendum date and its question. However, some of you may not realize that they played dirty with the BNP at the last minute. Let me explain how.\n\nThe BNP submitted a note of dissent on many of the proposals recommended by the Consensus Commission. The IG and the Commission were not satisfied with the outcome. That's why they initially tried to ignore the BNP's note of dissent by not incorporating it into the July Charter, but they were forced to do so when the BNP stated they would not sign it otherwise. Then they attempted to disregard the BNP's note of dissent again by framing the referendum question in such a way that the reforms desired by the IG, the Consensus Commission, and most parties would have a higher chance of receiving a YES vote. Just look at the options if you don't believe me.\n\n[Referendum Question](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gr8i1kcaze1g1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d24cc22d8eca02fba65b2c52cd94bf5f29e3009)\n\n  \n  \nThis was not supposed to happen. The purpose of the Consensus Commission was to include only those proposals in the referendum that received consensus from all 30 parties. I know the content of the first two questions did not, don't remember about the third option though. Only the fourth option reached consensus.\n\nThe BNP can't fully oppose this because if they do, they would be labelled anti-reform by almost everyone. Notice that other political parties like Jamat, NCP, Gonoodhikar Parishad and others aren't talking much about the question either because they are supportive of what the IG is doing as they benefit from it. \n\nThe BNP has already hinted that they will not accept the result imposed on them by some elites.",

        "body":"Hey everyone,  \nIm a 26 year-old male and I’ve been struggling with hair loss from a pretty young age. I have been visiting a doctor who prescribed me some medicines which I have been taking for the last 3 months.\n\nRecently, he suggested that I go for a **hair transplant** and also take **PRP treatment**. When I asked if I could recover some of my lost hair, he told me that whatever is gone is gone and that the only solution now is a transplant.\n\nBut I have seen some of my friends who had worse hair loss than me. They said they used **finasteride** and **minoxidil** and that it helped them. Finasteride stopped their hair fall and minoxidil helped regrow some hair.\n\nI did a bit of research and found that both drugs are **FDA approved** and can give results as long as you keep using them. So I asked my doctor about using finasteride and minoxidil but he didn’t prescribe them. He said these only help maintain existing hair and won’t bring back the lost ones.\n\nHonestly, its discouraging because Im spending around 10k per month but Im told there is no chance of recovery. It is just for maintenance. I don’t want to go for a hair transplant yet and I also don’t want to use any medication without proper medical guidance.\n\nSo Im thinking of **changing my doctor**, hopefully to someone who is experienced in treating hair loss and open to trying finasteride\/minoxidil under supervision.\n\n**I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone in Bangladesh (specially Dhaka):**\n\n* Are you using **finasteride** or **minoxidil**? What kind of results have you seen?\n* Any **recommended dermatologists or hair specialists** in Dhaka who treat hair fall properly and guide patients with these medications?\n\nI just want to get some honest opinions and maybe find the right doctor who can help me recover whatever hair is still possible to save.\n\nThanks in advance",

        "title":"My Story",
        "body":"I’m a 21-year-old boy. My father has schizophrenia. After I was born, my mother couldn’t breastfeed me. I’m the first child in the family, and when I was four years old, my little sister was born. My mother became very busy with her, and I didn’t get the time or care I needed.\n\nWhen I was a child, I used to spend most of my days outside, playing with my friends. They felt more like my family than anyone else. I would visit their houses and stay out until evening.\n\nWhen I was about seven or eight, I started to learn swimming. One day, some pond water got stuck in my ear and caused a terrible infection. My ear began to rot from the inside, and it was extremely painful. My father refused to let me take antibiotics, so for days I suffered before being treated with homeopathic medicine.\n\nWhen I was nine, my parents decided to move away. Leaving my friends behind broke my heart. The new place was quiet and lonely. I stayed home most of the time, surrounded by my parents’ constant fights. My father often left the house early in the morning and came back very late—or sometimes not until the next day. My mother would yell all day and curse him. Both of them worked as primary school teachers. I felt trapped in their arguments, and I often thought about dying.\n\nAfter finishing 10th grade, I left home to live with my maternal uncle in the capital city. I couldn’t really share my feelings with anyone.\n\nDuring my final year of high school, my father was admitted to the hospital for open-heart surgery. I visited him several times between HSC exams. His surgery went well, and he returned home, but he remained weak and struggled to breathe. Around that time, one of my aunts suddenly died of a heart attack, which shocked everyone.\n\nWhile my father was recovering, I wanted to return to Dhaka for my studies, but he was too ill. My mother and I argued a lot. My mind was exhausted—I couldn’t rest, and I couldn’t focus on studying. After more conflict with my mother, I finally returned to Dhaka and joined a coaching center to prepare for the engineering admission exams.\n\nPreparing for those exams is hard as we know. At my uncle’s house, there were problems too. I was moved into the drawing room to study and sleep, and I couldn’t concentrate at all. I cried to my mother for help, but she didn’t respond—she was overwhelmed with my father’s illness. My uncle’s family, meanwhile, was celebrating the birth of a new child. While I was struggling and crying for help, there was laughter all around the house.\n\nEver since I was little, I loved machines. I always wanted to be an engineer. My mother knew this. I used to take apart my toys and gadgets to see how they worked—flashlights, radios, even a television. I started learning programming (Python) when I was in class nine. But my parents and relatives all wanted me to become a doctor. They kept pressuring me, and I couldn’t study properly.\n\nEventually, I took the engineering admission exam but couldn’t get a good rank. I wasn’t surprised, because I hadn’t been able to study properly through all that stress. Still, there was one more chance—a central exam for 24 universities. I studied hard for a month and did well in the test. But in the end, I failed because of corruption in the system. That's another story.\n\nNow I’m studying Computer Science and Engineering at a private university. In my first semester, I achieved a CGPA of 4.00 out of 4.00. I’m doing well academically, but I often feel depressed when I think about my life. I have no real family bond, I’m not in a top public university, I don’t earn any money, and I never received the love or care I needed from my parents.\n\nSometimes it feels like I have nothing.\n\n  \nThe story is mine, just written in plain English using chatgpt and some edits by me.",

        "body":"Japan exports anime and manga. Kpop is also popular in Bangladesh due to their soft power strategy. India has soft power in Bollywood. Pakistan also increasingly has soft power in Bangladesh due to their cricket team and many women wanting Pakistani man.\n\nWhy doesn’t Bangladesh develop soft power strategy. Given it is a clothing exporter powerhouse they can develop soft power in fashion like Japan did. Today, people go to France or Japan for shopping because the value is in the branding and design, not just production. I myself shopped in Japan and went to their stores like Uniqlo. When someone sees Tiger or Mizuno shoes they associate with Japan, and France with LVMH. There is no reason Bangladesh can’t develop aspirational clothing brands with the supply chain they have. Bangladesh in addition to West Bengal was the textile capital of world so tradition is there. \n\nSecond thing is cricket. Sport is a great way of showing soft power. Thats why Saudi is throwing money at football and the Qataris and Emiratis sponsor so many leagues. Today, people worship England because they have EPL. People love Spain because they have Barcelona and Real Madrid. Cricket is second most popular sport in the world so Bangladesh should develop its T20 League with a clear cultural EXPORTING strategy. Just like Manchester United have overseas fans and plays exhibition matches abroad Bangladesh teams such as Dhaka Capitals and Khulna Tigers should do the same and develop global following in cricket playing nations. \n\nThese are just two ideas I have. \n\n",

My plan is to get admitted to the Physics department of the University of Dhaka (where I live) and do my undergrad there. For postgrad, I want to do my master's degree and PhD in theoretical physics at a top university abroad. I want to build my career in research and\/or teaching theoretical physics. \n\nSince there is basically zero opportunity for physics graduates in my country, I plan to move abroad for my career. To go through with my plan, I would need a fully funded scholarship for my Master's and PhD, as it's impossible for me to pay for education abroad. Unfortunately I don't have much idea about scholarships. If anyone can help me with what scholarships I could apply for and what opportunities they could be for me, that would be greatly appreciated. I'll also have 4 years ahead of me before my Master's, so I think that's enough time to prepare myself. So basically I need help with the idea of a roadmap. Suggestions on scholarship programmes I could apply for is also appreciated. I'm very dedicated to this goal, so I'd be very grateful to anyone who helps out, thanks 🙏",

        "body":"[The Daily Star](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/q5enr1h0u1yf1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f59e7faf286e3794262a189cbd81b0aeab9cefe)\n\nThe Daily Star is covering a series called **“Challenges in Policing,”** and the **first part expose a system that is collapsing under financial misery**, the **second part reveals:** many of the people responsible for our security are living in conditions that strip them of basic human dignity.\n\nThe barracks at **Banani Police Station** stand inside one of Dhaka’s richest neighborhoods, surrounded by glass towers and luxury apartments. But step inside, and the contrast is shocking. Officers sleep on rusty metal beds packed together inside suffocating rooms where even ceiling fans cannot be installed because the ceiling is too low. Case files are prepared sitting on beds because there are no desks. Bags are stacked on stairwells, walls are damp, the rooms are cramped, and pest control is a fantasy. Bedbugs bite them at night, mosquitoes during the day. Forty-two men share two toilets. There are no cleaners; officers clean the floors themselves after 12–14 hours of duty before they are allowed to rest.\n\n**The problem is not limited to Banani.** At Shah Ali Police Station in Mirpur 1, the situation is worse. There is no kitchen, so constables must eat outside, spending a quarter of their salary just to survive. There is not enough space to sleep. Some officers sleep on mosque verandas, some in community centers, and during busy weeks, many sleep on footpaths. Privacy doesn’t exist. A constable says he cannot even speak to his family over the phone at night because there is nowhere quiet to stand. There is also no rest area for reserve police officers—they sit outside for hours on chairs or rickshaws waiting for their shift to start.\n\n**These conditions are not just humiliating**—they affect policing. When a person is exhausted, living in heat, sleeping among insects, and working without rest, **can we really expect them to remain patient, professional, and morally firm every day?** We talk about police misconduct and corruption, but we never ask what happens when a system breaks a person down.",

People watched, filmed, and scrolled later.\n\nThis incident highlights the wider reality for women in Bangladesh: public transport can be unsafe, and many women spend extra money on private rides just to feel secure. According to BRAC's *Safe Roads for Women* report (2018), 94% of Bangladeshi women have faced harassment—verbal, physical, or otherwise—on public transport. A 2022 survey by UNDP, NHRC, and CRI found that 87% of women across 24 districts have been harassed at least once in their lives.\n\nBut this young woman fought back with a sandal, standing her ground.

Police stations cannot function with their current budget. Officers are sent to investigate murders with only Tk 6,000 from the government, when the **real cost is at least five times higher**. In one case, recovering a decomposed body in Ashulia cost Tk 9,100 before the investigation even began. The sub-inspector had to pay from his own pocket.\n\nBecause there isn’t enough allocation from the state, many police stations now survive through what officers openly describe as **“special funds.”** These funds are created through unofficial channels—*donations from businessmen, local political elites, and money taken from people who are desperate to get their cases moved forward or suspects released after bail. This doesn’t just create corruption*—**it makes corruption a requirement to keep police stations running**.\n\n**In Dhaka,** a police station receives Tk 40,000 a month as source money for operations, but spends over Tk 80,000 a month simply giving refreshments to daily visitors, many of whom are political figures. The station needs around Tk 1.5 lakh a month for basic supplies like paper, fuel, bulbs, toilet cleaners, and maintenance, but receives only a fraction of that every four months. Even detainees legally get Tk 30 per meal, but a basic meal today costs almost three times more. Police often end up feeding them from their own salaries to prevent starvation.\n\nVehicles are old and barely functional, making it impossible to respond to emergencies quickly. Fuel allocations are so low that officers sometimes rent private vehicles just to conduct operations. Officers admit the truth: they cannot meet public expectations because the system forces them to beg for funds informally. This is how integrity breaks—not always by personal greed, but by structural design.\n\n**Reform proposals already exist.** The Police Reform Commission has recommended more investigation funds, better operational budgets, a transparent audit system and direct funding for superintendents. But nothing changes if no one pays attention. ",

He was found the next day, October 23, in the Helipad area of Panchagarh Sadar Upazila, **chained to a tree by his leg and in a naked state**. Local residents discovered him and informed the police, who rescued him and admitted him to Panchagarh Adhunik Sadar Hospital.  \nMuhibullah claimed he was **abducted in an ambulance, tortured overnight**, and that he had been receiving **anonymous threat letters** before the incident. Some Islamic groups have protested in Panchagarh and demanded the arrest of those responsible.\n\n**When speaking to journalists** from his hospital bed, [Mufti Muhibullah provided a detailed account of his alleged abduction](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share\/v\/1D4osQWsEe\/) and the motives behind it. He claimed that around 7 AM on October 22, while he was out for a walk after Fajr prayer, **five men** in an ambulance forced him inside by covering his face. He alleged that they then subjected him to **inhumane torture**, including being stripped, severely beaten with a water-filled bottle on his thighs, and having his beard shaved off. He stated the five men spoke **\"standard Bengali\"** but did not sound like Bangladeshis, and they threatened to harm all Islamic scholars.\n\nHe claimed his abduction was the culmination of **months of threats** delivered via anonymous letters. According to his statements and the First Information Report (FIR) filed later, these letters, allegedly from \"ISKCON terrorists,\" demanded that he preach in his mosque sermons:\n\n1. In favor of **Akhand Bharat** (Undivided India).\n2. In support of the release of **ISKCON leader Chinmoy Das**.\n3. Against **Islam-based political parties, BNP, and NCP**.\n4. A **fatwa** stating that there is no barrier to love between **Muslim girls and Hindu boys**.\n5. To **stop using the words Allah, Muhammad, and Islam** in the mosque.\n\nHe alleged the letters promised him a **large sum of money (crores of rupees)** if he complied, or threatened him and his family with death and harm if he refused.\n\nFollowing the widespread outcry over the alleged abduction and torture, particularly with Islamic groups in Panchagarh staging protests against ISKCON, an investigation was launched. \n\n**However,** subsequent findings have cast serious doubt on Mufti Muhibullah's claims, leading [police to place him under investigation](https:\/\/www.kalerkantho.com\/online\/national\/2025\/10\/24\/1596268). Several CCTV camera footage from the area and time he claimed to have been abducted show Muhibullah Miaji **walking quickly by himself**, but there is **no footage of anyone forcibly picking him up** or of an ambulance stopping to take him away.\n\nDespite claiming to have been tortured for nearly a day and a night, Muhibullah was observed to have **returned to normal life** and gave a speech to his congregation shortly after being released from the hospital. The content and language of the anonymous letters he produced also raised suspicions. Critics pointed out that the letters contain a mix of seemingly contradictory devotional terms (\"[Jagat Joyi Kalimata\" and \"Buddhadev](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/share\/p\/1BUY8f2pty\/)\") and use words like **\"Adhikarik\"** which he himself noted is **not standard Bangladeshi official language**.\n\nAfter these inconsistencies came to light, Mufti Muhibullah was **interrogated by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)** and later admitted to a hospital in Dhaka, becoming unavailable for further comment.",

I've been doing my own research, but I would really appreciate some suggestions.\n\nI do have some criterias to consider as I have to think about my children in the future. Based on priority:\n\n1. Language barrier \n2. People (acceptance towards outsiders)\n3. Education (decent is fine)\n4. Weather (Dhaka-like weather is fine)\n5. Location (out of city bounds and bonus if close to rivers or water bodies)\n\n\nI would very much appreciate the suggestions. Thank you. ",

However, many of the teachers there often seem to endorse Jamaat and its narratives. I also found out fairly recently that all two of the room execs that I knew were Shibir-spawns in their college-uni era\n\nDuring the recent Indo-Pak clash, one lecturer made some pretty explicit remarks, things like *“Pakistan is our brother nation,” “The fall of Islamabad means the fall of Dhaka,”* and *“India opposes Jamaat because it’s the only true patriotic force around.”* (-\\_-)  \nI strongly despised those comments. I brought it up in the student TG group to see how others felt, and it honestly sent shivers down my spine to see almost everyone supporting that lecturer’s stance. I went on a rant about Jamaat’s war crimes during ’71 and so on and soon after, the channel admin locked the chat and asked everyone to refrain from making political remarks.\n\nSo what do y'all make of **RETINA**?",

It probably needs to be emphasized that I didn't have a normal childhood, I was taken off education at an early age of 11, so I spent the rest of my time getting better at English, computers and just general internet literacy. I was lucky enough to have had a Pentium 4 with a 1 GB RAM computer that was handed down to me and I remember struggling so much to run even basic programs.. but it got me started and kept me going when I had nowhere else to go.\n\nFast forward a few years, I become more proficient at English and general tasks, and take on transcription and translation based jobs. While supporting what little I can for my little dysfunctional family (Mom, little brother, me). Due to constantly being under financial stress, we probably had to move homes I would say.. a total of 25-30 times until now? Anyway.. I guess I made what I had Infront of me as a career and this gave me a chance to work at Augmedix when I was 18. 25k job. Though I hadn't gotten in for their scribing project, it was a different project at the time which was an annotation project (code based transcription for AI training), but since it was a temporary experimental project it was shut off after 6 months, and me? Laid off. I didn't have the educational qualifications needed for their scribing department and it was a requirement.\n\nSo I set my gaze on online jobs and came across Amazon Mechanical Turk. With the help of a boro bhai, I was able to set up a computer in US that we remotely used to.. well, work on the tasks on the platform. The person in US did take a small cut, but it was negligible. I would make around 5-10 dollars a day by working for 12-14 hours which probably wasn't a whole lot, but it did keep me afloat for a long time pretty much until 2020.\n\nHonestly the pandemic era wasn't so bad for me, I barely used to go out anyway so it hadn't been much of a change for me, however what was a change was the influx of jobs in the market. A lot more work started to become available online and people weren't super focused on educational aspects, and this landed me a great job at Appen (now called CrowdGen). It was a Bengali transcription job, and seeing my effort and good English, I was quickly made into a project manager. Pay was $2.5 an hour. I was ecstatic. But good things never last too long. At least not in my case. By the time I was done paying all debts around us and just started experience \"shochcholota\" this project too was abruptly taken off at the 5 months mark.\n\nAfter this I fell back into the same place again and well, went back to Amazon Mechanical Turk. Earned whatever I could, and started picking up some video editing skills though my PC wasn't really capable of keeping up with it. I tried many call center jobs too in the middle of this, but I.. I don't know why, but I feel debilitated when it comes to working in call centers. I never fared well, no matter how many times I tried. I became deathly depressed to the point I would rather take my life instead of working in another call center.\n\n2022 rolls on, and due to the rise of AI, Amazon Mechanical Turk slowly started to lose all it's microtasks and this resulted in.. well, becoming homeless. Me, my little brother and my mom, we spent an entire month on the streets. We used to somehow spend nights in various hospital lobbies and benches, parks, even spent a few nights at Kamalapur station. Probably the darkest days of life and my family. My little brother fell off a rickshaw and ended up being hurt really badly to the point he couldn't move one of his leg. This prompted me to ask for help desperately from all the friends I knew. And one of them did help me out. His parents were incredibly kind souls and helped us out with almost 20k worth of money, not counting how they helped with food, clothes, and even mugs and plates. We managed to get a tiny \"chilekotha\" room for 8k a month, but even that felt so relieving. We finally had a place to stay after being on the streets for an entire month. I remember spending the new year (2023) on the roof of that house and feeling free.\n\nWhile living in this tiny place, I tried one last time to work in a call center where the pay was genuinely good at $3 per hour, but by the end of the second week I was throwing up everyday before my shift from anxiety, I was having constant panic breakdowns during calls, and.. yeah. I couldn't bring in the results they had hoped for, as well as my deteriorating call quality because we only had a single room. We actually had to go out to take a shower, the stove was in the exact same room we slept in, there was no way to wash the dishes other than taking it downstairs, it wasn't really a convenient place for a job that requires you to work at night in a quiet environment. But I still l wish I somehow could've rewired my brain to work at this place. Anyway.. So I went onto search more jobs and through the help of a mutual, I landed another job as a dispatcher for a US transportation company that operated from Bangladesh. Pay wasn't great, only 25k and I had to travel from Mohammadpur to Uttara to work, but.. it was still work.\n\nI actually had help from this r\/Dhaka in 2023 where I explained my situation and how important it is for me to move to Uttara for my job after the horrible situation we had been in, and well, how our quality of life was in that chilekotha. I then moved to Uttara 18 (RUAP) with the help of the people from this sub as well as my boss from the workplace. It felt so amazing to live in a flat again, haha.\n\nSo.. I don't know what it is, whether I'm just a bad luck charm or my fate is just meant to be horrible, the company I mentioned I was working in? They had to downscale drastically after I was working 4 months there. In the beginning, the person who hired me did so because he couldn't handle the amount of work he had. We were handling the dispatching of 6 trucks. By the time the 4th month rolled around, one of the driver crashed and went out of business, the main contractor (4 trucks) got kicked out of his company and that turned into a single truck, and the other driver became less regular at his work due to health issues. So after cutting down my pay to 15k, he just couldn't afford keep me anymore so well, I got laid off once more at the 6th month.\n\nWe started getting pushed down by debts once more, 3 months of rent became due and that's when the best job until now came along. Actually I got my contract just 2 weeks prior to our civil war. It was a job from TelusDigital, but they were being subcontracted by Bytedance. Basically, we were working on the algorithm for TikTok Bangladesh. My first lakh-taka job. Though the process rigorous in itself, I still passed all of their insane tests with flying colors and even helped 3 other pass. I was the best performer in the job for 18 weeks straight. I was happier than I had ever been. 5$ per hour, 1 year contract, I was convinced I would get out of my situation as long as I diligently worked at this role.\n\nBut yup, you probably guessed it at this point, their AI\/algorithm was ready at the 6 months point and they laid off everyone despite the 1 year contract. I couldn't really save any money either because I paid off the dues from before, and bought a fridge, some basic household items, and a laptop for my little brother. When I was laid off, I did pay 4 months of rent in advance, but we started struggling to have even basic meals. In this time, I tried whatever I could do, content creation, learning to code, making a SaaS, graphics design, nothing panned out. Luckily through the help of an old friend from Augmedix, my little brother (16) managed to find a job of his own. He is working in the making EMRs (Electronic medical records) for doctors in the US, and I couldn't be prouder of him. It pays only 20k, but he's doing what I haven't been able to in the past.. 9 months now.\n\nThe thing is that.. the debt has piled on so much now that we've been told by the house owner to move out next month if we can't pay off the dues. And I'm deathly scared of landing on the streets somehow again. My little brother doesn't earn enough for us to move, advance, and find another new place. I shouldn't even be relying on his income anyway, but I've probably applied to over hundreds of places now without anything panning out. Experience doesn't mean anything if you don't have an education.\n\nAnd I guess that's my TED talk, guys. My life and struggles so far has amounted to absolutely nothing. I'm just a nobody failure, and it honestly hurts. The only reason I don't give up is because I can't give up. My mother and my brother doesn't have anyone but me. I can't bear to see them suffer, my mother crying from hearing all the debters saying horrible shit, my brother not being able to sleep in peace because he feels like we'll become homeless again.. I am supposed to be their beacon of light, yet I'm just.. fucking useless.\n\nAh man.. Anyone going through a similar struggle of being jobless?",

Also there is a long distance trauma.She texted me for 1month non stop even after i aggressively told her to fuckoff.At last seeing so much desperated txt,i told her to meet me,then i will see.She came on march 27🙂She is an angel,literally my dream girl.We talked,before leaving i asked her to hold her hand,she gave away without a second thought. Btw that was my first ever sitting with a girl on a date.I fell for her.After some days she shared she had a relationship for 2years. Her bf cheated so she left.I asked her if she was physical,she said no,convinced me.I did let it go saying everyone has a past.\n\nWe were in deep love for 4months.She was sweet af,did everything possible for a gf in long distance. She supported me,cared for me on insane level.She texted gm every morning.Used to call me to wake me up for uni.Sometimes while talking she used to share her past relationship stories.I used to get insecured at that moments.I never had relationship before,all my life i was a decent, academically sound student.I was busy in studies.I also studies in one of the most reputed Engineering uni,also in top dept.Anyway,insecurity was silly.Like someone had her type feeling. On a night while talking, she suddenly started sharing her ex did this,playing victim while we were talking about us, our future.I was disturbed.Also about this time i get to know her frnd circle 🙂Most of her frnds were non virgin,almost everyone. Even some had abortion.I was in doubt how can she not have sex in 2years?She even justified things like \"sex krlei sarajibon eksathe thaka lagbe emon na\",\" sex to mistake\" while talking abt her frnds.After sharing id pass i went to her story archive saw her male frnds and past relationship stories.She went to movie date(one day she told me she knows wht people do in movie date),i saw her male frnds kole niye chobi tulse,she story dicche proudly🙂also so many male interactions,male frnds stories.I saw in her messenger she was telling a frnd she did visit her ex even after 1year of their brkup,she received gift from him.She dated multiple boys after brkup🙂\nI was shocked.I never expected this.Now i think all the desperation she showed was not love,was to bag a good guy,to get rid of her past.The insecurities that she had sex grew up so fast🙂i ended that relation forcefully, now im broke.I feel nothing about the world.I gave her my whole heart,i even fixed my marriage with her we planned everything 🙂I just cant sleep now.She was my first love,my only love.I had so many things to do in plan when she will come to dhaka.Everything is gone.What can i do🙂Should i go back to her or let this go.",

I am overseeing a few teams who are responsible for Backend, QA and DevOps. Initially I started my career in Dhaka and was employed by a few multi-national companies like Telenor\/Grameenphone. Almost a decade ago, I graduated in CSE from a low-class public university in Bangladesh with a very low CGPA. So, I am not able to advice on any academic things unfortunately.\n\nI wanted to do this for a while but didn't get the time.

What do people cook for weddings, holidays, or big gatherings?\n\n5️⃣ How is food usually **served or eaten** — banana leaves, metal plates, clay dishes, hands? Is presentation important?\n\n6️⃣ What’s typical for **tea time** — are there unique snacks or sweets that differ from Indian mithai?\n\n7️⃣ Do some dishes or ingredients have **symbolic meanings** (good luck, family, love, home, etc.)?\n\n8️⃣ What are the **key cultural symbols** of Bangladesh — animals, plants, patterns, or colors that carry special meaning?  \n(I came across an idea that **a lizard is a guardian of the home** — is that true?)\n\n9️⃣ Are there **traditional patterns, ornaments, or crafts** that often appear in food culture — like embroidery, textiles, or tableware?\n\n1️⃣0️⃣ What’s the general **attitude toward food** — is it more about family, comfort, spirituality, street culture, or just the joy of flavor?\n\n1️⃣1️⃣ What does a **daytime street food market** feel like — sounds, smells, colors, chaos? How would you describe the atmosphere?\n\n1️⃣2️⃣ What does **hospitality** mean in Bangladeshi culture? Are there sayings, customs, or gestures tied to sharing food?\n\n1️⃣3️⃣ Do you know any **restaurants, cafés, food trucks, or delivery places** that serve *real Bangladeshi food* outside Bangladesh — especially in Russia or Europe?\n\n1️⃣4️⃣ If you’ve been there — **what dish or flavor stuck with you the most**, and why?\n\n1️⃣5️⃣ And lastly — **what feeling do you associate with Bangladeshi food?**  \nIs it comfort, heat, noise, family, chaos, or something else entirely?\n\n\n\n💬 Any stories, photos, memories, or links will be a huge help for my research.  \nThank you so much in advance for sharing your experience ❤️",

What was supposed to be a smooth five-hour journey turned into a distressing experience because of one extremely rude and disrespectful passenger.\n\nAs soon as I boarded, I placed my two hand luggage bags in the overhead compartment. Immediately, a man started shouting at me, saying things like:\n\n“Why are you putting your bag on my side? Where will I put mine?”\n\nI calmly explained that there was enough space in the middle compartment and even offered to help him with his bag. Instead of accepting help, he continued yelling and refused to listen.\n\nAt first, I ignored his behaviour, but it quickly escalated. He aggressively removed my luggage from the compartment without my consent and shockingly began insulting my mother with disgusting, sexist language.\n\nAt that point, I stood up and confronted him — no one should ever tolerate such disrespect, especially towards women. Thankfully, the cabin crew and nearby passengers intervened before the situation got worse.\n\nThe Emirates crew handled the issue professionally and supported us throughout. We filed an official complaint so that the airline could keep a record of his behaviour for future flights.\n\nThis post isn’t just about one rude passenger — it’s about the bigger issue of misogyny, aggression, and lack of respect that too often goes unchecked, especially on routes from South Asia. As frequent flyers, my mother and I believe no one should have to endure such verbal abuse in a civilised setting.\n\nI hope airlines continue to take stronger action to protect passengers — especially women — from harassment and verbal violence on flights Emirates",

They started saying things like “Bangladesh destroyed itself,” “it’s a failed state,” and other disrespectful comments. Many used very offensive language.\n\nBasically, they don’t follow their own logic. To them, anything desi automatically belongs to India.\n\nBefore today, I used to think India wasn’t that bad, and that we all belonged to the same subcontinent. I didn’t understand the hate.\n\nBut now, I do.\n\nBefore this experience, I only knew a few Indians — my friends — and I mistakenly thought all Indians were like them.\n\nIndians are just a bunch of entitled idiots (obviously there are some exceptions)\n",

        "body":"Salaam everyone,\n\nI’m looking for some advice, please.\n\nAbout a year ago, I bought an IPS and battery package from a retailer on Nawabpur Road, Dhaka and had it delivered and installed in Sylhet.\n\nRecently, the battery developed an issue, so we sent both the battery and IPS back under warranty. About a week ago, the retailer called to say the battery had been serviced and returned from the manufacturer, and that it would be delivered to Sylhet on Saturday or Sunday. Unfortunately, no delivery was made. Since then, they’ve stopped responding — they don’t reply on WhatsApp, they cancel calls, and I think they may have even blocked me.\n\nI work abroad, so I can’t visit the shop myself. My relative called them, they initially spoke to him but now they cancel his calls.  I could ask someone to visit the shop on my behalf, but it would mean a long trip from Sylhet to Dhaka.\n\nWhat are my options here? Has anyone experienced something similar, or can suggest the best way to deal with this? I’m worried they may just ignore us now and avoid delivering the product altogether.\n\nThank you.",

All I do is play video games, and browse social medias and random forums. But I cannot keep living like this. Every weekend I wanna go out and hangout with friends. But there's no one absolutely. And it's killing me inside. I'm losing my sanity. I just keep praying to get done with weekends as soon as possible. Is it a part of growing up? Is it just me or everyone else out there?

It would convince the Hindus here, that we are treacherous fanatics, waiting for our opportunity to persecute them. There is already a feeling that wherever Muslims become a majority, it is impossible for minorities to live among them. \n\nThe reaction of such incidents is also borne by Bengali Muslims in India - in the form of mass detentions, arrests, eviction drives, and home demolitions (as are recently being seen in Assam).\n\nOf course, beside this, it is the humanitarian and legal duty to maintain peace, and provide the fullest religious freedom to all Minorities. \n\nDurga Puja is almost here, I pray that it happen in perfect peace, proving the nobility of our Community and our sincere wish to live in Peace with the Hindus.

        "body":"The DUCSU 2025 election took place on 9th September 2025, and the results are out. Shibir's landslide victory in the election surprised most people, and many are still struggling to accept it. This is just my personal analysis and observation of the election. To be frank, I am very much anti-Shibir ideologically, but I do congratulate them on their victory because this is how democracy should work. Perhaps I will garner downvotes from both sides, but putting that aside, here is an attempt to analyze the event and the aftermath objectively.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThis was the first DUCSU election since 2019. Out of approximately 39,775 registered students, an impressive [\\~75%](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2025_DUCSU_election#Vice-President_election) cast their votes. Shibir won by a huge margin in the top three posts - Vice President, General Secretary, and Assistant General Secretary. Out of the remaining 12 posts in the central committee, [Shibir won 9 seats](https:\/\/www.prothomalo.com\/bangladesh\/7shgm6t3ll), and independent candidates won 3 seats. Out of the 15 seats in the central committee, there are 13 more seats. Shibir won in 11 of them, 1 was won by an independent candidate, and the other by a leftist candidate.\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/en.wikipedia.org\\\/wiki\\\/2025\\_DUCSU\\_election#Vice-President\\_election](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8dp92i0doeof1.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=662a72bb59b9d70e00946f92c0931b44c7b8d3c7)\n\nInitially, many candidates like [Abid](https:\/\/www.prothomalo.com\/politics\/ddaaksu-nirbaacn-kaarcupir-abhiyog-aabidsh-dui-praarthiir) from Chatra Dal, [Umama](https:\/\/www.prothomalo.com\/politics\/yr9ll5lv3u), Meghmallar, and [Abdul Kader](https:\/\/www.prothomalo.com\/politics\/798953r10n), called the election a fraud and denounced it. It should be noted that there were indeed several issues, discrepancies, and mishaps during the election. But it seems these were in the minority, and it is [unlikely to have impacted the election results significantly](https:\/\/www.prothomalo.com\/politics\/jtegu85p55). It is [not rational](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kallol.mustafa\/posts\/pfbid0BhqJRAfxujZ42gZbM7pXvCdakaD79z66ciw1dga2sPTTfaWfrT8wA7UycX9L6paml) to make claims of election engineering without strong evidence. However, controversies in JUCSU and [such claims](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kazijesinbd\/posts\/pfbid035hT9mSugPNNK7rDh9yfQjdFn5b3Q1v8SEgAYrrzmxYwP5Wj3UqTQm1LswemrJtQbl) do have some merit and perhaps we should also attempt to find out the answer to [these questions](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/meghmallar.bosu\/posts\/pfbid02tv7bpyJAYRWTJRp2znJNh9iM9ycFLU51ZzFzTCKSyfRpK12An8HthGEnQif964Yrl).\n\nBut it seems likely that it was a fair election which Shibir won. This leads us to the next point - understanding how that outcome came about. As I said, I am ideologically strongly anti-Shibir, but to counter their ideology, we need to understand the problem and how it happened first. Below, I outline and rank these factors in order of importance.\n\n**Clean Positive Image, Welfare-based Politics, And Humility**\n\nAs surprising as it might sound, this seems to be the [biggest reason](https:\/\/www.prothomalo.com\/bangladesh\/g9wby5oaqm) to me. The Shibir candidates have a strong positive image on campus. Shadik Kayem, who became the VP, is also one of the leaders of the July Movement. Shibir also actively did welfare-based politics - helped poor students, organized career training and programs, various social welfare, and [innovative ideas](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/saerzulkarnain\/posts\/pfbid0Yeo87r6h2Fh2eTgbsX69ww1hUptMSsdvmo9F8MwqBthZb78VLK5YdniysPCraK6yl). Chatra Dal and the leftist organizations fall behind significantly on these aspects, at least when considering scale and dedication.\n\nShibir were humble and genuine throughout the campaign and even [after victory](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pMmbVbQaDFA). People do not like arrogance and attitude, especially after a mass uprising. You can question their intent and ideology all you want, but there is no doubt that this is the perception they were able to create with their actions.\n\n**Frustration With Other Political Parties And Weak Opposition**\n\nChatra Dal is stupid, frankly speaking, and does not have their priorities right. It is quite easy to see through their superficial acts and rhetoric. NCP is very controversial, divided, and arrogant. If NCP were not so controversial and divided, it could have participated in the election united and also would have garnered tons of votes from the swing voters. The independent candidates were good, which is why they won 5 seats and got many votes, but they also don't have the political strength and backing. Therefore, many students were unsure and could not rely on their promises and how much they would be able to deliver, despite their goodwill.\n\nAs for the leftists, it's a bit different. When there is an injustice, leftist organizations are usually the first to take a stand against it, and this is great. But what about the common daily struggles of the students? Imagine a poor student outside of Dhaka struggling. He\/she finds solace when Shibir bonds with them, shares spiritual stuff, helps them with career development, provides food, etc. What do the leftist parties do? Leftist parties mean well and promise changes, but in practice, they fall short in terms of delivering them to the common students via structured campaigns and activities. Left-aligned individuals are nice and often help others, but this gets associated mostly on a personal level and not with an ideology\/party. Whereas in the case of Shibir, the party benefits because of its structure and strategy. The leftist parties do have their limitations despite good intentions. For example, they do not have much funding. On the other hand, Shibir is very organized and has access to large funds from various sources.\n\n**Organization Structure And Campaign Strategy**\n\nShibir is methodical, organized, united by a common ideology, and recruits\/grooms meritorious students from an early age. They have been preparing for DUCSU for more than a year. Their door-to-door campaign and interaction with students were nothing short of remarkable. While others were busy playing checkers, they played chess. It's a long-term game, and they were very focused on their goals and pursued them methodically.\n\n**Social Acceptance**\n\nThe two biggest criticisms of Shibir are being anti-1971 and being extremists. They [still are](https:\/\/www.shibir.org.bd\/center\/uploaded\/CONSTITUTION%20book_Final_2024.pdf) in many ways, but they have managed to convince a large part of their members and supporters, and also the swing voters otherwise. As for 1971, they never disown or condemn the roles of their predecessors but diplomatically pay tribute to the freedom fighters and the liberation war. It is very questionable and ambiguous at best, but combine that with the rise of anti-1971 propaganda (not necessarily from Shibir) and how BAL used, distorted, and sold 1971 to justify their crimes, Shibir succeeded in creating an illusory image that the present generation of Shibir is not anti-1971 and should not have to bear the crimes of their ancestors.\n\nAs for extremism, they have managed to trick others with deception and manipulation. They have many intellectuals like Mirza Ghalib who are not extremists in the traditional sense and often justify their fundamentalism and problematic policies with diplomacy and word salad. With the intellectuals and social media activists, they were able to portray themselves as liberal democrats with a mix of religious\/ethical dedication in the eyes of many.\n\n**Vote Splits**\n\nI would have ranked it much higher had Shibir not won by a huge margin. Notice that a significant portion of the people still voted against Shibir. For the [VP post](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2025_DUCSU_election#Vice-President_election), there were four other good candidates, and the votes were split across them.\n\n**Rise Of Fundamentalism**\n\nNo doubt that fundamentalism and right-wing politics have risen in Bangladesh. There are many reasons for this, not diving deep here for now. It is important to note that many Islamic parties and right-wing individuals are strongly against Shibir. But nonetheless, a significant part sympathizes with Shibir. And due to their somewhat aligned goals and hatred for liberal democracy and leftists, it is likely they voted for Shibir.\n\n**Victimhood**\n\nShibir was oppressed by BAL for years. BAL also normalized attacking or even killing people by tagging them as \"Shibir\". For example, the murder of Abrar Fahad. It didn't matter if they did Shibir or not. When you oppress a group like this, you end up making them victims and martyrs. And naturally, people sympathize with them.\n\n**Liberal Hypocrisy And Elitism**\n\nWhen liberals remain silent as Hefazot is massacred in Shapla in 2013, when liberals blockade Shahbagh for weeks, and instead of demanding a fair and impartial trial, deliver the sentence themselves while chanting hateful and violent slogans, when liberals enable BAL's atrocities just because they believe there is a greater evil. When some liberals resort to [hateful acts](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/faisalxahmed01\/posts\/pfbid02QtrDVdh4hxxowJNNBJZ4MKp6NGRSY5q75FBw3EcdGaGT5S87ARd32dNN5kUS2ge2l), and the others are silent (is it much different from some fundamentalists doing hateful acts and moderates staying silent?). Do all these create a positive or negative branding about their values and ideologies? Heck, it does not matter how correct your ideologies or values are if your actions are like this.\n\nIs there a difference between \"kanke mage hejab koi???\" and \"Look at those brainless Hijabi KFC chickens simping over Shibir\"? Is the difference a matter of ideology or mentality? Hatred only brews more hatred, and before you know it, you end up becoming the monster you started to fight yourself. There is a difference between being strong and being a bigot. You could strongly make the point why you think the Hijab is a symbol of modesty and should be preferred, but not imposed. Or you could strongly make the point why you believe that the Hijab is a symbol of oppression due to how it is enforced and how women are conditioned. Instead of doing that, what are you achieving with hate? Do you want to see the world burning, or do you want to influence and change others to follow your values? Even if you are right rationally, what does it tell others about your values if your actions are hateful? Will you influence others or push them away?\n\nAnd no, it is not being diplomatic or always taking a non-binary stance. Some things **are binary**. If someone is against democracy, against human rights, you don't excuse that by taking a non-binary position. You stand against them firmly and fight it. You just don't have to become like them in the process.\n\nAll these things act like slow poisoning. It pushes people away. If a swing voter were considering voting for you, they would be repelled, and then they must choose between the lesser evil. Perhaps they agree with you on how the other side is so bad, but you pissed them off so bad with your elitism and hypocrisy that they would rather vote for the bad guys than you. This is literally [one of the biggest reasons](https:\/\/www.paulgraham.com\/woke.html) why someone like Trump is in power in the US.\n\n# If Shibir Is So Good, Why Don't You...\n\nThat's a lovely question. Dr Zahed explains it much better than I can ever [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=c113p8ewMUw). I also shared my reasoning earlier [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bangladesh\/comments\/1nauanz\/%E0%A6%A1%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B8_%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%AC_%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AF_%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%9A%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%9B%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%B0_%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95_%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%9F_%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%AF_%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%A3\/). Shibir's politics is [identity politics](https:\/\/annas-archive.org\/md5\/15a5c6b4cc7c7b0ab75c99c9a3ae29c0), which always excludes instead of including everyone. BJP and Hindutva, Trump's white supremacism, Israel's Zionism, Jamaat's Islamism are all the same. History teaches us that nothing good ever comes out of it, no matter how charming they might seem initially.\n\nThey have the following in their constitution. They leave it purposefully vague so that when someone confronts them and questions how their goals are anti-democratic, they can twist their argument with word salad and mental gymnastics and argue how it's not. But one only has to look at the mainstream interpretations and wonder why they have so many details in their booklets, but they never specify how exactly democracy and democratic values will work in their system. They never clarify their interpretation of the religion and how they will use it to rule the country. It's bits and pieces to lure people with deception and manipulate them to gain their support. Hypocrisy and ambiguity everywhere, the perfect example of a wolf in sheep's clothing.\n\n\n\n[https:\\\/\\\/www.shibir.org.bd\\\/center\\\/uploaded\\\/CONSTITUTION&amp;#37;20book\\_Final\\_2024.pdf \\(Page 10\\)](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/a1cspuwavlof1.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a964bf51858b76c154b673df74ffcd08d1e606)\n\nThey are against democracy, [against equal rights of men and women](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LVONB0hdr0o?t=2710), and many universally accepted human rights. They seek to impose their perceived version of an Islamic Sharia, even though [most Islamic parties strongly oppose Jamaat](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ioXBubjsSao) in terms of ideology. They are a political party in a democratic system that seeks to come to power with democracy and trickery, and when they do come to power, they will destroy the very same democratic values themselves.\n\nJamaat supporters and sympathizers, does it sound absurd to some? Or is that what you want as well? Are you an extremist or just brainwashed? Don't believe me? Well, it's right in their damn [booklets](https:\/\/www.shibir.org.bd\/center\/uploaded\/kormo_proddhoti.pdf) and [constitution](https:\/\/www.shibir.org.bd\/center\/uploaded\/CONSTITUTION%20book_Final_2024.pdf). It's a dangerous philosophy and a recipe for disaster.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nWhile this won't significantly impact the upcoming election, it is likely to have a long-term domino effect and end up in one of two ways. While the BNP still appears likely to win the upcoming election, the contest will be far more competitive than many expected. In the longer term, however, the real test will be whether the leftists, liberals, and centrists can reform and rebuild their politics. BNP will also need to do the same. If this possibility happens, then there is a silver lining, and we have a chance.\n\nThe other possibility, which is also more likely, is that nobody learns anything, and this begins the first step towards us moving backwards. Right-wing parties and fundamentalist groups could re-emerge with renewed confidence. gaining political traction. Moral policing and harassment will increase. Over time, this trajectory could pave the way for a party like Jamaat to ascend to power. It wouldn’t necessarily mirror Afghanistan, but the state of human rights, especially for women and minorities, would deteriorate sharply. Economic growth would be stunted, international relations and trade would suffer, and the country could spiral toward anarchy, civil conflict, or even foreign intervention.\n\nThe fundamentalists and extremists are already delighted by this result, and they did not wait for long to start the shitshow - [Example 1](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Anik0000\/posts\/pfbid02KyNgH6THnmgCHwozXBnwW49GEYCC1UaWnkr1dsdbd9WnsEsA9TF4VVSkboHXVUwBl), [Example 2](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Anik0000\/posts\/pfbid02ur4gw68qA89dv5mdcM8WvxCjjMAMqSJCZPedvXatYGvw11FEGP5TM8tAZjpKjo6nl), [Example 3](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/arunimatahsin\/posts\/pfbid0ZRuAenSiH48G8UbUCNfCx67x6vxVPQfps2z5wrUSfvwKmGoTwCBcg7ptxQbHXBL6l), [Example 4](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Anik0000\/posts\/pfbid02aCg9ZtdFKNcxNGFGYKzLsuit5advcCeJnPm2pPNnm4ej941ZjhJnbcWwNsuvnwpLl), [Example 5](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/parvezalambd\/posts\/pfbid02KcjVVZAnVGNDyoASjaLKAUcQhh3Eo3mcsKzuga6JmJ9d7daJcyVZsc9ko8Cb5DaUl). The rest will follow eventually.\n\nTo the voters who voted for Shibir - knowingly or unknowingly, you guys set the ball in motion. Either we will get a better r\/bangladesh, or r\/LeopardsAteMyFace is our future. Let's see what the future awaits.",

        "body":"First of all, let me make this clear, I am a 2nd year college student (HSC 26) who was recently kicked out of Inter 2nd year college. Now, I am planning to take this diploma rather than finding a new college to get admitted. It may sound stupid to some people for not finishing HSC, but if there is any possibility to study a BSc in Computer Science in Australia with a diploma, please help. I just want to get out of the Bangladeshi education system.\n\n\nBack story: Its my dream to be an engineer. as all we know in bangladesh, we have to take science for it. I took my SSC in science group and got A-. Took science in college too. Its a cantonment college btw. Maximum student failed on the final exam. Then the college make some exceptions for avarage students and took retake for the bad students, again maximum failed. But i was in the exception group. College gave use condition, after a 1.5 week there will be a CT (CLASS TEST) on 30 marks. Students have to pass 4 sub least. Also the principle added they will add extra class, after the college hours ends we can pick teacher who will take class on their subjects.\nMany days pass we didn't got the extra class but 2 teacher came forword and started the extra class with their own willpower. We only got 4 extra bio class and 2 extra chemistry class. At the time we were middel of the exam. Our result came i got 5 F and 2 pass. Many of my friends quickly Take TC and started their new college without the year gap.\nBtw In that college after this months ends the Pre-Test will start and their will be more student fall. Whats the point if they plan to cut off some student after CT if they want to cut now. \nThere is a huge resons why the college is doing this. For the new 1st year students the college incresed the seat number from dhaka board but there is no space for the extended seats they issued. We have 3 science sections  the day after the result the college combined 3 science section to 1 science section for the 2nd year. Left 2 free room for 1st year (newcome). Sometimes I wonder politics should learn politics from that college.",

        "body":"So stunt man turned director Sam Hargrave made a film called Extraction. It was based on a book called Ciudad (City in Spanish) as the setting was South American and therefore all the Asians in Extraction were based on South Americans.\n\nHowever for reason I cant find answers to. Sam decided to have the setting be Bangladesh, a South Asian Muslim majority country. He even hired Bangladeshi filmmaker Raffael Ahsan to translate the Bengali parts of the script to keep the language accurate too. The film was originally named Dhaka and was going to be entirely set in Bangladesh (minus Chris Hemsworth Australian scenes)\n\nHowever things fall apart when Ahsan found the cast were non-Bangladeshi and couldnt learn the language well enough. Casting director Sarah Halley Finn and Sam Hargrave denied Ahsans request to find Bangladeshi actors on the idea that none are famous enough to garner attention for the film. Add in the fact an Indian Producer was brought on and apparently made more changes possibly Saju and Ovi being Indian Hindus instead of Bangladeshi Muslims. It had lead to accusations of Islamophobia within the film purposely using Bangladesh as a Muslim country of faceless canon fodder.\n\nBut it got me thinking. What if Sam Hargrave took up Raffael Ahsan's suggestion? What if he decided to do what Gareth Evans did for Indonesia with the Raid and cast talented actor with ancestry from the country it was set? What Extraction was the Bangladeshi Raid?\n\nWell this is what Ive come up with if Extraction had a Bangladeshi led cast and still called Dhaka. Most of the characters would likely be renamed to fit the Bangladeshi actors heritage\n\nDana Abraham Hannan as Tyler Rake. Dana is a 6'2\" Dhaka born Canadian actor with n amateur boxing background. I chose him for his muscular build, tattoos and martial arts experience that would make him essentially resemble an Asian Chris Hemsworth. Id rename the character Tariq Rahim.\n\nAydin Ahmed as Ovi. Aydin is a British Bangladeshi child actor best known as Kevin Chipman in Deadpool and Wolverine. I felt that Ovi, his dad and Saju should be from Sylhet, Bangladesh instead of India. So British Bangladeshis would make sense for them as most British Bangladeshis are Sylheti. Aydin's dad Ifte Amed could easily play Ovi's Dad in the short prison scene Saju. Id rename the character Ali.\n\nJan Uddin as Saju. Jan is also a British Bangladeshi actor. With his fit build, long hair and 6'1\" stature. Id say he matches Randeep Hooda look. Jan was in Marvel Agents of Sheild as Isaiah and was Asimov Solensa in Cowboy Bebop. So he has some action experience. Sarah Finn Halley should be aware of him too as she regularly casts Marvel projects so how she didnt cast him for Extraction when he was in a Marvel show around the time he film was in preproduction is beyond me. Id rename the character Sajjid (tho Saj or Saju would be realistic nickname for a Sajjid)\n\nFarzana Due Elah as Nik Khan. Its not confirmed if Nik Khan is Bangladeshi. Her name which Im assuming is Anika \"Nik\" Khan wouldnt be out of place for a Bangladeshi. The sequel reveals she is French Bangladeshi which is not as common as British Bangladeshis or Italian Bangladeshis. But this is due to her original actress being French Iranian. I ld love to see if British Bangladeshi Farzana Dua Elahe could play an action girl role. She was in Our Girl as a Bangladeshi too. This characters name would be the same\n\nIslah Abdur Rahman as Yaz Khan. Yaz is Niks younger brother. He is a cameo at beat in the first film but more important in the second. Tho his actor is French Tunisian (thus making Nik and Yaz French Bangladeshis presumably), this versiom would British Bangladeshi like Islah Abdur Rahman. Rahman has experience in HwarangDo which would be great for Yaz Khans fight scenes, tho he onoy really had one in the sequel and almost died to a large mercenary woman after killing 2 of her men. Im assuming Yaz's full name is Yaseen \"Yaz\" Khan.\n\nChar Avell as Gaspar. For some reason Tylers only friend living in Dhaka is a massive American named Gaspar (Im assuming he is married to a Bangladeshi woman as he mentions a wife but she isnt seen so who knows). But I chose Char Avell as Gaspar as the singer is 6'3\" making him slightly taller than Dana (same way David Harbour is taller than Chris Hemsworth). It would mean this version of Gaspar would be a British Bangladeshi who has moved to Dhaka. Char has some acting experience from web series and once with the BBC series Coconut. But I can definitely see him do a short role like this. Gaspar would be renamed Ghazan.\n\nTaskeen Rahman as Asif Amir. Taskeen is a Bangladeshi actor (who he has lived in Australia quite a lot). Taskeen get typecast in Bangladesh for villain roles a lot due to his Blue Eyes. In Bangladesh light coloured eyes are called Shada Soke (White Eyes) and are seen as creepy or souless. Which is likely why Taskeen gets villain roles a lot.\n\nMahi Alam as Farhad. Mahi is a Bangladeshi American singer and actor best known for American Born Chinese as Anuj and the Mean Girl remake as Kevin Ganatra. So this would be the first time having him play a Bangladeshi.\n\nSaikat Ahamed as Colonel Sadik. Saikat Ahamed is a British Bangladeshi actor. I mostly chose him due to his age as Sadik is a older man and spends most of his action scenes Sniping. So Saikat can get into good shape for it. But doesnt need to be a crazy hand to hand fighter for this kinda role. Plus the head shot of him looks like he can pull off an aged and serious military man.\n\nIn addition to having Bangladeshis in the cast the plot will revolve around a corrupt goverment official from Dhaka (the original plan was Asif Amir is from a government family but Ahsan felt that was too contriversal tho recent events in Desh shows this to be accruate) will kidnapped the child of a Sylheti crime KingPin so that a Bangladeshi Canadian mercenary is sent in due to his firmiliarity to the city and its language. \n\nIf I could also add one more thing. Id get Grandmaster Mak Yuree to be the cultural advisor to the action scenes so that the Bangladeshis would be using the Bangladeshi martial art Butthan for the film same was The Raid had Indonesians using Pencakt Silat for that film just to show Bangladeshi Martial Arts in a big budget action film.\n\n",

একই যুক্তি কি এখানেও খাটে না? অতীতের দায়মোচন না করে যারা সামনে আগাতে চায়, তাদের ভরসা করা কতটুকু যৌক্তিক আর নৈতিক?\n\nআচ্ছা, এবার মুক্তিযুদ্ধ বাদ দিলাম। অন্য প্রসঙ্গে বলি। ইসলামী ছাত্রশিবির নিজেদেরকে একটি ইসলামী আদর্শভিত্তিক ছাত্রসংগঠন দাবি করলেও তাদের কার্যক্রমের মধ্য দিয়ে প্রায়ই চরমপন্থী ও উগ্র রাজনৈতিক প্রবণতা স্পষ্ট হয়েছে। সংগঠনটির [ঘোষিত উদ্দেশ্য](https:\/\/www.jamaat-e-islami.org\/publication\/file\/185_constitution_Jan_2020.pdf) হচ্ছে ইসলামী সমাজব্যবস্থা প্রতিষ্ঠা করা। এই লক্ষ্য বাংলাদেশের সংবিধানপ্রদত্ত ধর্মনিরপেক্ষ ও গণতান্ত্রিক চরিত্রের সঙ্গে সাংঘর্ষিক। লক্ষ্য অর্জনের জন্য তারা ছাত্র সমাজকে প্রভাবিত করতে চায়। যার জন্য তারা স্কুল থেকেই তাদের কার্যক্রম শুরু করে এবং বিভিন্নভাবে প্রভাব খাটিয়ে কোমলমতি শিক্ষার্থীদের তাদের আদর্শে আনতে চেষ্টা করে, যা কিনা অনৈতিক কারণ এটা অনেকটা মগজধোলাই। এবং তারা এটা করে ধর্মের নামে, যেহেতু তারা ধর্মভিত্তিক পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি করে যা কিনা গণতন্ত্রের জন্য বিপজ্জনক। জামায়াতের আদর্শ মওদুদীবাদের বিপদ সম্পর্কেও [এখান](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GBagqYrn9tg) থেকে আরো জেনে নিতে পারেন এবং কেন অনেক ইসলামী দল এবং আলেম এর বিরোধিতা করেন।\n\nধর্মভিত্তিক পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি শুধু সংখ্যালঘু নয়, বাকিদের জন্যও বিপজ্জনক। বিশ্বের বিভিন্ন দেশে দেখা গেছে, যখন ধর্ম বা জাতিগত পরিচয়ের ভিত্তিতে রাজনীতি জোরদার হয়, তখন সহিংসতা ও গৃহদ্বন্দ্ব বেড়ে যায়। যেমন ভারত এবং বিজেপি সরকার এর একটি বড় উদাহরণ। পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি সমাজকে একত্রিত না করে বরং খণ্ডিত করে। আর এখানে যখন ধর্মের বিভিন্ন ব্যাখ্যা আছে, তখন বিষয়টি আরো বিপজ্জনক হয়ে যায় যা কিনা অসহিষ্ণুতা বাড়িয়ে দেয়। যদি উদাহরণ দেই, ধরেন আপনি ধার্মিক এবং হিজাব করেন। আপনি নাও করতে পারেন এবং দুই ক্ষেত্রেই সেটা আপনার ব্যক্তিগত মত এবং অধিকার। তবে ধর্মভিত্তিক এসব দল ক্ষমতায় আসলে আপনার তাদের ব্যাখ্যা এবং মন মতই পর্দা করতে হবে। এই অসহিষ্ণুতা এবং জোর খাটানোর প্রবণতাই সব থেকে বিপজ্জনক।\n\nআর খেয়াল করে দেখবেন যে শিবির ধারাবাহিকভাবে মুনাফেকি রাজনীতি করে। তাদের গঠনতন্ত্রে নারী নেতৃত্ব নিষিদ্ধ, তাদের নারী কর্মীদেরও নেকাব করা বাধ্যতামূলক কিন্তু ডাকসুর প্রার্থী হিসেবে তারা এমন কিছু নারীকে দিয়েছে যাদের জন্য আবার এমনটি প্রযোজ্য নয়। এই দ্বিমুখী আচরণের যৌক্তিক ব্যাখ্যা কি? বিপরীতমুখী হয়ে গেল না? তারা যদি সত্যিই পরিবর্তন আর আধুনিক হত, তবে কি দ্বিমুখী আচরণ করতো? প্রকৃতপক্ষে এটা আসলে ধোঁকা ছাড়া আর কিছুই না। গুপ্ত এবং মুনাফেকি রাজনীতি করবে, সুবিধা নিবে কিন্তু কোন দায় নিবে না। যেমন কয়েকদিন আগে তাদের একজন কর্মী [গণধর্ষণের হুমকি](https:\/\/www.prothomalo.com\/politics\/29czmjum2o) দিল, কিন্তু আলোচনায় আসলে গুপ্ত রাজনীতির সুবিধা হিসেবে দল হিসেবে কোন দায়ই নিল না। আর অনলাইনে ধারাবাহিকভাবে নারী হেনস্তা এবং যে কোন সমালোচনার [হেনস্তা](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/abdul.qader.790007\/posts\/pfbid01JSoFFZeUBSiiRCDaCvKZGvvssu3X3C1GjvUHguefgSKwW5gEsHL7ZF9F6fFQ3Yal) তারা করেই যাচ্ছে ক্রমাগত।\n\nআর সবশেষে যে বিষয়ে বলবো তা হচ্ছে শিবির কি বাকি ছাত্র সংঘটনগুলোর থেকে আলাদা?

Growing up, I saw my friends with girlfriends, spending time together, talking for hours, having someone to lean on. Which is great, but what really hit me was... how far many of those if not all \"relationships\" went. Their girlfriends would send them nudes, do s\\*xchats over video calls, and in some cases even go as far as doing s\\*xual things in restaurants or some other place.\n\nI’ve never experienced anything like that, and now it worries me deeply. I keep asking myself: what if the woman I marry someday has a past like that too? Is this what I “deserve” for not being like the “normal” guys? AM I ALREADY FALLING BEHIND?\n\nAnother thing that confuses me: if a woman has done things like showing her body to multiple people, had casual encounters, or even let someone touch her just for something as small as a *400 takar lunch* at a restaurant, and then years later decides to “change”... does that make her the same as me? Does she still deserve my full love, respect and loyalty? People often say the past doesn’t define someone’s worth, but honestly, I struggle to accept that.\n\nAnd now I’m even more terrified because I can literally see myself being taken over by dark thoughts. I feel myself judging all my female classmates just because they’re female (It's been less that a month since I started attending university). In my mind, even if they had similar pasts, they’d never talk about it openly. They’d just think, “It was his fault, and I’m entitled to start fresh as if nothing happened.” This single thought makes me resent people for no real reason. Worse, I can’t even concentrate in my classes if the course instructor is a woman— because for all I know, she could be just like all the others.\n\nI know this isn’t healthy, and I don’t want to become bitter or hateful. I’d really appreciate if someone could help me get out of this mindset. I’d especially love to hear from people older than me, women, or anyone who has gone through something similar. And if you comment, please mention your age and gender. It would mean a lot.",

The task requirements are written well, if need  clarification then discuss with the team.   \nRecently, I have to conduct meeting with the business holder or clients. There I need to conduct presentation, share demos, gather requirements etc.   \n  \nThe problem is I can understand what they say, I mean my listening skill is good but not the spoken skill. I can manage short conversion or meeting without a problem but when it takes long time then I am out of words or struggle to manage words. Sometime my struggle got noticed easily. Besides I have pronunciation problem as well. \n\nI have noticed that because of spoken proficiency, at many important meetings I did not get invitation for the presentation, although the task was done by me. I am feel very disappointed. \n\n  \nAs a Bangladeshi, I think its a common problem for many of us as we don't have much places for practicing.  \n\nI have heard about spoken course, IELTS etc. Should I enroll one of them? Are those really helpful?   \nOne of my juniors shared his experience like these are not that helpful instead I can practice at home at regular basis.\n\nSo can you guys suggest me what can I do?

I also emailed them, and they confirmed the same thing. But I’m still lowkey unsure because almost every other university in Bangladesh requires physics or at least some science subjects for architecture.\n\nCan anyone confirm why BRAC is different here?

Last night a lot of my family members were invited for the celebration of my parents' 25th anniversary, and due to me being an admission candidate, the talk about what I was preparing for came up. I said I am prepping for DU B and C and their face went pale as I said something so blasphemous that their comprehension cannot imagine. Their first question was. \"you read science your entire life and passed HSC with great grades; why are you going for commerce or arts? Why are you not prepping for buet?\" and in response I said that I want to stay at BD, and the current engineering market is very bad, and I don't want to study in a discipline that has so little potential here at bd. and their response was there is a huge market for engineering at BD, and then they proceeded to say the most hilarious thing i have heard in a while. They said, \"Desher CSE er to onek demand.\" I just wanted to laugh so hard. As I didn't want to argue with them, I said that \"mama, amar to eto brain nai CSE porar\" and left the living room and said to myself how unaware people are when they give any advice. When the potential of CS graduates getting a stable and good-paying job is at an all-time low in the entire world. when tech mammoths are laying off people, there are so many uncles that give this unsolicited advice. These people just cannot think for 2 minutes before spewing out uncalled advice, and the fact is they aren't illiterate or anything. They just feed into the echo chamber without realising what is happening around the world. These people make me so mad it's just insane",

        "body":"There are over 9,000 public libraries and more than 125,000 librarians across the United States, all of which offer a wide variety of resources and services to the communities they serve. Similarly, Australia has a fantastic network of public libraries across all its states. Users can access an extensive catalogue of print, electronic, and multimedia resources as well as free Wi-Fi, computers, printing services, study spaces, groups, classes, and much more by joining a single library. \n\nAccording to the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, neighboring India also has an impressive library network, with approximately 1.5 million libraries, including 1.3 million school libraries—the highest single number of libraries globally. The country also hosts over 160,000 public and community libraries, with one public library for every 8,333 people, which is more than double the Asian and global averages. In Sri Lanka, according to the National Library and Document Services Board (NLDSB), there are approximately 1,500 public libraries—one for every 14,595 people. The respective local governments and urban and municipal councils govern all public libraries.\n\nCompared to India and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh has only 71 public libraries, a disproportionately low number considering the population—resulting in there being one public library for every 2,402,143 people. How embarrassing is that? \n\nI gathered the above information from The Daily Star. For all the talk and complaining we do about \"lack of civic sense\" and political and social justice, we don't pay attention to the very real cause of it all, low access to education especially in rural regions and the distinct lack of libraries in this country. Instead of protesting for delaying or cancelling exam results or forming new colleges or other ludicrous purposes we should protest to increase the availability of books across the country, not just the Capital. This will undoubtedly encourage young under-privileged men and women who want to be educated but don't have the money to enroll in a school. And, as a result will instill civic sense, duty and national responsibility in them.",

Meanwhile, look at other countries and their men. Arab and bengali guys look so similar but are so far off each other lookswise because bengali men dont look after themselves properly. Honestly, your looks show ur discipline. Im not telling u to look like a 10\/10 but atleast clean up properly. This is why u guys complain 24\/7 about being single.\n\nSecondly, a vast majority of u smoke and drink which causes u to be even uglier and look older. If a woman did the same, you wouldnt even look at her. A lot of u dont even pray 5 times a day and then claim to want pious wives. Honestly ask yourselves if u would want a wife who is like u exactly😂🤣.\n\nTo you girls, theres good men out there actually so dont settle for these chapris. We should start settling for better looking men not the old wrinkly ones who smoke and stink. Truth is a man wouldnt look at u if u were also their level of ugly.  Its our fault for settling for losers. Now theyre comfortable with being one. And honestly if u dont mind the perfect match in this life, thats ok. We only have like 40-60 years on this earth \n\n\nAnd honestly, whatever i listed is still bare minimum.\n\nI cant wait to see the same men complain in the comments. If the shoe fits, cinderella😂. Just aim to be better in life rather than barking like a dog in these comments\n\n\n\nEDIT: Im giving up on convincing u losers in the comments to be a better person for ur sake. Your body is a direct reflection of ur mental state. IF u cant take care of it, ofc you will complain about others having higher standards. Love urself and treat ur body better ",

In many views, it is the weakest administration in Bangladesh’s history: so weak that even the United States would not pursue reciprocal tariff arrangements with it!!\n\nIts leaders often appear timid, unable to control the streets during a period that saw over 1,700 protests in 500 days!! They seem novice and ineffective, struggling even to pass laws, let alone enforce them!! The Interim Government has repeatedly buckled under pressure from relatively small or little-known groups!!\n\nOver the past 15 months, the IG has been bombarded with accusations of inertia and incompetence. Many dismiss it as a “do-nothing, makhon-khawa group” that stumbled into power by luck and achieved nothing and now was looking for an ignominous safe exit!!!\n\nAnd yet, when I look back, I say with confidence that this has been one of the most consequential governments of Bangladesh in many decades. It has achieved almost everything it set out to do.\n\n#Peace and stability restored. Post revolution revenge attacks brought to a halt.\n\n#The US tariff deal was secured without hiring a single lobbying firm.\n\n#A record number of laws were enacted in just 15 months, including sweeping new labour reforms.\n\n#The July Declaration established a historic new platform, and the July Charter created a political settlement that may reshape national politics for generations.\n\n#The Supreme Court asserted control over the lower judiciary, making it far more difficult for future governments to weaponize bail decisions or pursue politically motivated cases.\n\n#One of the world’s leading port operators signed the Laldia Terminal agreement, laying the foundation for a manufacturing transformation. It is the single largest European investment.\n\n#A new foreign policy framework has positioned Bangladesh at the centre of the Indo-Pacific.\n\n#The economy has been stabilised and returned to a growth trajectory.\n\n#Banking-sector plunder was curbed, the taka stabilised, and inflation contained—food inflation falling from 14 percent to seven.\n\n#According to court proceedings, accountability began to emerge for past abuses, and a long-awaited sense of justice has begun to take shape. Sheikh Hasina has been shown her place!!\n\n#Forced disappearances ceased, the BAL extremist political culture that once dominated our national life has been neutralised, and a cultural revival has followed—bolstered by widely viewed documentaries detailing earlier abuses. It is a Farooki- effect!!\n\n#The RAB now operates under the law rather than informal doctrines, and intelligence agencies have retreated from harassing dissidents. \n\n#Freedom of press and freedom of speech have been restored. Not a single staged “crossfire” incident has been reported in the last 16 months.\n\nI could go on. As an avid reader of our history, I believe no government in Bangladesh has achieved as much in such a short period as the IG has over these fifteen and a half months.\n\nFull stop.\n\n#DhakaDiary",

The workers were nice tho ngl about that, even the owner was friendly but when it came to the money side and how long Iam \"working\" there they get pretty strict, obviously I don't like it anymore, i mean fair i learned quite a bit talking with different kind of customers and learning how to use adobe Photoshop and word etc. but.. is it really worth all that? Opening the shop at 9am and cleaning it up myself like... I don't know if im the one who's getting alot and still complaining or other way around, i only feel bad because the staff there were genuinely good people I liked hanging out with.... But that wasn't my goal at the start.. I joined in to learn.. which i stopped doing after awhile. Also another thing is.. Im one of those bekar unemployed, not studying anymore guys, that was the reason i joined this place like 3 months ago... I don't know what to do with my life, clearly this isn't it since im just wasting time here, but I don't know what else I can do...\n\nEdit: thought I should share a bit about myself. Iam 19 years old, I used to live in Oman and came back to Bangladesh at 2022 because i had visa problems, I missed my highschool exams i was basically part of the 2022 batch of SSC examinees.. which i missed and i didn't study since, been 3 years, dad went to UAE 2 Years ago and I thought he'd take me soon.. its been quite awhile im still here.. it's kinda funny but anyways.. I don't know how much longer im gonna be here but I don't want to waste it, someone bestow some wisdom on me, im really broke so IELTS is not on the table right now, im saying this because i got suggested this one multiple times. Im really broke right now, not just me, my whole family, hence why Im still here in bd instead of going to UAE because I can't buy the damn visa and some other stuff. Anyplace i can learn some work.. whatever kind of work that would benefit me later on where I might be able to make some money aswell... Again please don't say IELTS or school.. give me some proper advice older brothers and sisters of this subreddit 🙏",

But she couldn't pursue her career to take care of my older brother, who has autism.\n\nI finished my admission exam in 25. I actually got a seat at DU B unit, but as it was a low-ranking subject, I decided not to pursue it after studying for a couple of months. I chose to enroll in a Private University to get a good subject.\n\nIg my mom didn't like that. Now, like in every argument, she tells me \"Kono public e chance peye dekhate paros nai\", \"At least amra nijer ma baba ke khushi korte parsi DU te pore\", and if I correct her sentences or oppose her arguments in any other topic, she just replies with \"Tui toh DU teo tike thakte parli na\" and shii.\n\nIk that DU is tuff for this country, but Idk, now I don't even wanna study anything anymore. Her arguments are seriously getting under my skin. Today we argued and she said \"Tor toh kono bhalo bondhu o nai, amar bondhu ra at least DU te porse, tui toh gazadi der sathe ghure beras\" like tf???? She doesn't even say sorry, and if I argue too much, she decides to spit in my face and call me \"Kulangar\" and a \"Devil's spawn\".\n\nA couple of days back, I actually went to the private university I wanted to get admission in, just to check out the campus and to know a few details about the subject and the cost. My mom insisted that she come with me. I bought her along with me. I talked to the Apu at the office and got the details. BUT, when we were about to leave, my mom just stood up and told the Apu that \"Janen amar chele er ageh DU te chilo, and amio DU r student\". The girl sitting behind us just looked at me like \"Really, is this fr??\" I felt so embarrassed, I just walked out. So is anyone's mom like tis or am I just losing my mind over nothing?\n\nWhat type of Institutional pride is this?",

The laptop was originally bought in 2021 and worked fine until I replaced the display in early 2024 due to scratch marks. After about a year, the new display started glitching, showing a horizontal white line and occasionally going completely black. Over time, the screen stopped displaying anything except a faint backlight. I tried updating drivers, reinstalling the OS, and even detaching the HDD, and the laptop worked briefly before a charger accidentally fell on the keyboard from about 40 cm. Since then, the display has been blank again, although the system still powers on. Multiple technicians couldn’t identify the issue, with guesses ranging from GPU to cooling problems. Battery health is also poor. Now, the laptop only shows a dim backlight with no image. I need help figuring out the real cause and whether it’s something repairable possibly a cable issue, display failure, or something else. Any guidance would be appreciated.  \n  \nPlease refer some trusted laptop repair shops in Dhaka \n\nThanks for your time",

Not because I dislike people or friendships, but because my heart moves slowly. I connect deeply, not quickly. I have a small circle, and it takes me a lifetime to truly let someone in.\n\nThe last few years have been messy for me. And a few months ago, I pushed myself to step out of that shell I had lived in for so long. I tried to explore life more, talk to people more, socialize more, and allow myself to feel a little lighter.\nBut now I feel exhausted in a way that is hard to explain.\nOverwhelmed. Drained. Lost.\nLike I took ten steps forward just to end up standing in the same old place again.\n\nI don’t want to distance myself from the few people I genuinely care about, because I don’t want misunderstandings or to seem uninterested. But at the same time, I feel like I can’t handle too much anymore. My mind needs silence but my heart doesn’t want to hurt anyone. And this conflict is eating me up.\n\nI don’t think everyone would understand this sudden wave of emptiness I’m feeling — how it comes without warning, how it makes my efforts feel wasted, how it reminds me that healing is not a straight line. It’s confusing, and honestly, painful.\n\nStill, I won’t give up. I know life requires adjusting, and maybe this is just another phase I need to breathe through.\nI just wanted to share this here, without being judged or misunderstood, because writing feels like my only escape sometimes.\n\nIf any of you feel the same way, you’re not alone. You can share your thoughts too or tell me what helps you survive these phases.\nAnd whatever you’re going through, please be kind to yourself and to others.

On result day, all the relatives kept calling again and again — it was so annoying. I don’t even understand why they care so much about my result. My mom even said that if I don’t get admission anywhere, I won’t even have the right to show my face to anyone. You tell me is an A+ really that valuable in Bangladesh?

বেশিরভাগ মানুষ এমন ক্ষুদ্র ঝামেলায় জড়াতে চান না। তাই এটাও ছেড়ে দিলাম।\n\nকিছুদিন পর কেউ একজন এন-এর বিরুদ্ধে অভিযোগ পোস্ট করল—একজনকে হুমকি দেওয়া এবং রাজনৈতিক সংযোগের ইঙ্গিত নিয়ে। তখন আরেকজন সম্মানিত কমিউনিটি লিডার—ধরি তার নাম এ—পাবলিকলি লিখলেন যে বুলিং, হয়রানি বা বৈষম্য কাউকেই ছাড় দেওয়া হবে না।\n\nআমি তাকে ব্যক্তিগতভাবে জিজ্ঞেস করলাম,\n“যদি যিনি এগুলো করছেন তিনি কমিউনিটি লিডার হন, তাহলে?”\nতিনি বললেন, ভুল তো ভুলই।\n\nতখন আমি তাকে পুরো ঘটনা খুলে বললাম—কীভাবে আমি শুধু নিজের কমিউনিটির সাথে সংযোগ করতে চেয়েছিলাম, সাহায্য করতে ও নিজেও কানেক্টেড থাকতে চেয়েছিলাম।\nভাই এ এন-এর সাথে যোগাযোগ করেন। কাজিনকেও বললাম বিষয়টি। আমি একটাই কথা স্পষ্ট করলাম—পুরনো ব্যক্তিগত ঝগড়াকে অজুহাত বানিয়ে কাউকে কমিউনিটি থেকে বাদ দেওয়া অন্যায়। অ্যাডমিন হওয়া মানে কারও উপর ব্যক্তিগত ক্ষমতা খাটানোর লাইসেন্স নয়।\n\nকাজিন এবং ভাই এ দু’জনই এন-এর সাথে কথা বলার চেষ্টা করেন, কিন্তু সে বিষয়টি এড়িয়ে যায়। শেষে সে শুধু জানায়—সে আমাকে গ্রুপে নেবে না। কোনও যুক্তি নেই, কোনও ব্যাখ্যা নেই—শুধু জেদ।\n\nঅনেকে সহজেই বুঝতে পারবেন আমি কার কথা বলছি, কারণ এর আগেও তাকে বাংলাদেশের একটি রাজনৈতিক দলের সাথে জড়িত বলে অভিযোগ উঠেছিল। মজার বিষয়, সে নিজেই বলেছিল সে দলের নয়, কারণ সে নাকি তাদের বিরুদ্ধে “প্রোটেস্ট করেছিল”—কিন্তু তার আচরণ ঠিক সেই গত দশকের দেশের রাজনৈতিক চরিত্রগুলোর মতো।\n\nসে এমনকি আমার কাজিনকে বলেছে কিছু নির্দিষ্ট আত্মীয়কে নাকি অভিযোগ করবে এবং “অ্যাকশন নেবে”—মানে পরিস্থিতি বাড়াতে চাইছিল, অথচ আমার উদ্দেশ্য ছিল শুধু ন্যায্যতা। আমি কাজিনকে বললাম—মানুষ জানুক বা না জানুক, আমার আপত্তি নেই; আমি শুধু চাই অন্যরা জানুক কীভাবে কিছু লোক ভদ্রতার মুখোশ পরে ব্যক্তিগত শত্রুতার বদলা নেয়।\n\nদীর্ঘদিন ধরেই তার আচরণ নিয়ে বিভিন্ন মানুষের কাছ থেকে গুজব ও অভিযোগ শুনেছি—যেগুলো আমি বলব না, কারণ তার মতো পেছনে লাগা বা অপবাদ দেওয়া আমার উদ্দেশ্য নয়।\n\nযা আমাকে সবচেয়ে বিস্মিত করেছে—সে আমাকে ব্যান করলেও, স্বাস্থ্যখাত সম্পর্কিত কোনও তথ্য জানতে কেউ তাকে জিজ্ঞেস করলে সে আমার নম্বর তাদের কাছে দিয়ে দিত।\nকারণ “এন ভাইয়া আপনার নম্বর দিছে”—এই কথাই শোনা যেত।\nমানে, তার নিজের প্রয়োজনে আমি ভালো, কিন্তু কমিউনিটিতে আমার থাকা সে মেনে নিতে পারে না।\n\nআমি প্রচুর জাতিগোষ্ঠীর মানুষের সাথে কাজ করেছি—অস্ট্রেলিয়ান, পাঞ্জাবি, ফিলিপিনো, নেপালি, সাউথ ইন্ডিয়ান—কিন্তু এমন নোংরা গেটকিপিং আর কোথাও দেখিনি। যাদের কাছে গিয়েছিলাম তারা চেষ্টা করেছেন—সেটা আমি সম্মান করি—কিন্তু বেশি কিছু করার ছিল না।\n\nতাই হ্যাঁ—এমন সাপে ভরা মানুষের ব্যাপারে সতর্ক থাকুন। তারা বাইরে থেকে হাসিমুখে সাহায্যকারী সাজে, ছোট্ট কোনও উপকার করলে দশজনকে বলে বেড়ায়, অথচ আড়ালে ক্ষমতার অপব্যবহার করে। যে সত্যিকারের সাহায্য করে, সে চুপচাপ করে; সে ক্ষমতা দেখিয়ে মানুষকে অপমান করে না।\n\nআমার ব্যক্তিগত ভাবে তেমন কষ্ট নেই। আমার কাজ ও পড়াশোনা ভালোই চলছে, আল্লাহর রহমতে সব ঠিক আছে। দুঃখ শুধু এই—বিদেশের মাটিতে নিজের কমিউনিটির সাথে কানেক্ট হতে চেয়ে, সংস্কৃতির টান বজায় রাখতে চেয়ে, কেউ একজনের ছোট মনের কারণে এমনভাবে দূরে সরিয়ে দেওয়া হয়।\n\nসত্যিকারের সদাচরণ নীরব।\nসত্যিকারের নেতৃত্ব ব্যক্তিগত আবেগ নয়, কমিউনিটির স্বার্থ দেখে।\n\nএমন ভণ্ড, ছদ্মবেশী মানুষ থেকে সাবধান থাকুন। নিজের পরিচিতজনদেরও সচেতন করুন।\n\nআর যদি আপনারা জানেন কীভাবে এমন মানুষদের ব্যাপারে আরও বেশি মানুষকে সচেতন করা যায়, তাহলে আমাকে জানান।”",

Later the next day was off day and I was suppose to join from today (15th of Nov). So i was told to be present there at 10 am. After that, the receptionist told me to wait for the HR and I waited for like 2 goddamn hours. Then they told me to go the cabin where HR and the manager were present. They let me sit and told me that we aren’t continuing with you because of the post you made (are you fucking kidding me!?) I simply said that it was my right to know about your company since your digital presence isn’t visible enough. Then she dared to threat me saying that, 'eshob khetre amra police case kore thaki, apni fresher dekhe kichu korini' duh. Tarpor the manager started giving me lecture but i left the room right away. They were kept saying that miss we arent finished yet PLEASE kotha shunun Like DUH you've wasted  my 2 fucking hours now you want me to listen your lecture???? Mind you they didn’t even bother to let me know beforehand.  \n\nPS after living the office i went to a park and cried like a baby thinking of this humiliation. \n \nPS I made the post anonymously.

The app shows the live position of running trains so you can locate your train easily. My goal is to make train tracking simple and helpful for everyone.\n\nYou can try the testing version by following these steps:\n\n**Step 1:** Join the tester Google Group [(link here)](https:\/\/groups.google.com\/g\/mytraintrackerbd) \\[ [https:\/\/groups.google.com\/g\/mytraintrackerbd](https:\/\/groups.google.com\/g\/mytraintrackerbd) \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Install the app from the Play Store [(Playstore)](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app) \\[ [https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app) \\]\n\nNote: Without step 1, step 2 won't work. If the app does not appear, please make sure you are using the same Google account for both steps.\n\nAfter trying it, if you notice any issue in loading, tracking, or timing, please share your feedback in the comments.\n\nHope this makes Bangladesh Railway travel way less stressful for everyone!",

I can stretch my personal expenses a bit, so I’m willing to take calculated risks just nothing extreme.\n\nA bit about my background so you can suggest better:\n\n* I’ve worked **2+ years as a Business Development Manager** (client acquisition + client management + scaling accounts) Before that I worked as a Freelancer on Upwork since 2021 and had Top Rated badges on there.\n* Experience in **telemarketing**, **WordPress web design**, **affiliate marketing**, **social media marketing**, and **client hunting**\n* Previously collaborated with **international call centers**, providing them with projects and helping them operate\n* Overall, I have a good understanding of **digital money-making models**, but I’m now looking for something more strategic or higher-ticket\n\nWhat I’m hoping for:  \nA **realistic roadmap**, investment ideas, or business models where my experience fits and where 2 lakhs can be enough to get started. Sometimes one suggestion from someone else’s experience can open a whole new direction so I’d really appreciate your input.\n\nIf you’ve built something similar before or know someone who has, please share what worked for you.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "body":"I felt so bad for her. I’ve never seen her laugh loudly. And on the rare times she did, she would suddenly stop and recite the verse. She was also taught the line: “হাসিলে কাঁদিতে হয়, জানিবে নিশ্চয়,” so she believed that if she laughed too much, she’d cry even more. But what good did that do? Even without laughing, she still cried. Since my childhood, I’ve seen her crying again and again.\n\nHas a similar thing happened to any of you? Share your experience.",
