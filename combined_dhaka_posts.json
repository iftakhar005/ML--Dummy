The hosts controlled much of the first half and survived a scare when Hamza Choudhury cleared a goalbound Indian effort following a defensive mix-up. Hamza nearly scored himself just before the break, while both teams played mainly for pride since neither remains in contention for the 2027 tournament. The win is Bangladesh’s second of the year after their friendly triumph over Bhutan.",

        "body": "The government collapsed in July–August 2024 after a student-led protest because citizens demanded merit over quota. Sounds noble, right? Except the whole thing was hijacked from the very beginning.\n\nThose naïve, illiterate social-media activists and the “cool Dhaka kids” who wanted some good Instagram content ran to the streets without realizing a basic truth: BNP–Shibir gundas hijacked the movement on day one. They staged everything. They used those same cool Dhaka kids as puppets. They manipulated every moment of it.\n\nAnd nobody ever stopped to ask a single real question:\n\nWho are these NCP “student leaders”? What are their qualifications? What drove them to lead this protest? When did these uncles disguised as students actually graduate? What have they done with their lives besides student politics?\n\nThe same people who screamed about merit are now perfectly happy letting these criminals become the next representatives in government.\n\nI am not supporting one side over the other. I am simply asking everyone to think for once.\n\nDo you really want to live in a cave and pretend that:\n\nThe Awami League government falling automatically turned Bangladesh into a civilized, developed South Asian utopia under Dr. Yunus?\n\nBecause here is the reality:\n\nYunus is not making any key decisions. His cabinet is. And they were chosen based on quota, not medha.\n\nIn any functioning country, an interim government must be neutral, not tied to any political party. But our current administration is doing the exact opposite. Whenever NCP orders Yunus to do something, he complies out of fear.\n\nAnd honestly, this feels exactly like what the plan was all along.  \nPeople forget he formed Nagorik Shakti (Citizens’ Power) back in 2007.  \nConnect the dots.\n\nThis government is intentionally delaying elections while handing NCP an open license to operate. Meanwhile Nepal had a government collapse and their interim immediately declared election timelines… exactly what an interim is supposed to do.\n\nYunus is enjoying his new status and free private flights to new destinations on taxpayers’ money, while the Bangladeshi cool kids think being “politically conscious” means trash-talking a party that has already fled the country, or using fancy buzzwords to blame foreign nations instead of holding the current administration accountable.\n\nNow let us talk about the outcome.\n\nThere is no solid evidence that the original cause gained anything. It is a full-on shitshow.  \nThe trial was a shitshow because it means nothing.  \nThe world is literally laughing at Bangladesh.\n\nDeath sentencing people in absentia is a joke, but people ate it up and celebrated anyway.\n\nWhat did the interim actually change?\n\nThe economy is collapsing.  \nMurders, robbery, theft, rape statistics are skyrocketing.  \nThe garments industry is struggling with hundreds of factories shutting down.\n\nBut sure… the so-called “student leaders” are making slogans and people are cheering like everything is fine.\n\nAnd then there is the new trend online.\n\nPeople are making cool edits of Lutfor Zaman Babor, acting like he is some hero out of a Netflix series. Why is everyone blindfolded? or why the “student advisors” who magically appeared out of nowhere suddenly became the face of the movement. Not a single person questioned what medha qualified them to “advise” ministerial portfolios. But somehow they went from nobody to VIP overnight. Rags to riches, just like that.\n\nAnd then there is the sudden obsession with Tareq Zia, who has now become everyone’s eye candy. People act like reposting aesthetic edits of corrupt political bloodlines is activism.\n\nStudy history. Learn about their smuggling stories. Learn about JI.  \nLook at patterns.  \nYou are being emotionally manipulated by social media every single day.\n\nDo not let TikTok edits and Facebook reels generate your political opinions. Think for yourself. Stop idolizing netas who have done nothing for you.\n\nBlaming “the West” or “India” will not take Bangladesh anywhere.  \nBlaming outsiders is the easiest way to avoid looking in the mirror.\n\nEducate yourself.  \nLearn the facts.  \nStop being a pawn in someone else’s political game.",

I also worry a lot about the risk of a major earthquake. people laugh it off, but it feels like only a matter of time before Dhaka faces something serious. So I’d prefer a place that’s relatively safer in terms of earthquakes. Also, with good medical facilities near by, as my parents are getting old and I don't want to risk anything.\n\nWhat do you think about Rajshahi? I really liked the city when I visited.

        "body": "I think you all know that the Interim Government has finalized the referendum date and its question. However, some of you may not realize that they played dirty with the BNP at the last minute. Let me explain how.\n\nThe BNP submitted a note of dissent on many of the proposals recommended by the Consensus Commission. The IG and the Commission were not satisfied with the outcome. That's why they initially tried to ignore the BNP's note of dissent by not incorporating it into the July Charter, but they were forced to do so when the BNP stated they would not sign it otherwise. Then they attempted to disregard the BNP's note of dissent again by framing the referendum question in such a way that the reforms desired by the IG, the Consensus Commission, and most parties would have a higher chance of receiving a YES vote. Just look at the options if you don't believe me.\n\n[Referendum Question](https://preview.redd.it/gr8i1kcaze1g1.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d24cc22d8eca02fba65b2c52cd94bf5f29e3009)\n\n  \n  \nThis was not supposed to happen. The purpose of the Consensus Commission was to include only those proposals in the referendum that received consensus from all 30 parties. I know the content of the first two questions did not, don't remember about the third option though. Only the fourth option reached consensus.\n\nThe BNP can't fully oppose this because if they do, they would be labelled anti-reform by almost everyone. Notice that other political parties like Jamat, NCP, Gonoodhikar Parishad and others aren't talking much about the question either because they are supportive of what the IG is doing as they benefit from it. \n\nThe BNP has already hinted that they will not accept the result imposed on them by some elites.",

I have been visiting a doctor who prescribed me some medicines which I have been taking for the last 3 months.\n\nRecently, he suggested that I go for a **hair transplant** and also take **PRP treatment**. When I asked if I could recover some of my lost hair, he told me that whatever is gone is gone and that the only solution now is a transplant.\n\nBut I have seen some of my friends who had worse hair loss than me. They said they used **finasteride** and **minoxidil** and that it helped them. Finasteride stopped their hair fall and minoxidil helped regrow some hair.\n\nI did a bit of research and found that both drugs are **FDA approved** and can give results as long as you keep using them. So I asked my doctor about using finasteride and minoxidil but he didn’t prescribe them. He said these only help maintain existing hair and won’t bring back the lost ones.\n\nHonestly, its discouraging because Im spending around 10k per month but Im told there is no chance of recovery. It is just for maintenance. I don’t want to go for a hair transplant yet and I also don’t want to use any medication without proper medical guidance.\n\nSo Im thinking of **changing my doctor**, hopefully to someone who is experienced in treating hair loss and open to trying finasteride/minoxidil under supervision.\n\n**I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone in Bangladesh (specially Dhaka):**\n\n* Are you using **finasteride** or **minoxidil**? What kind of results have you seen?\n* Any **recommended dermatologists or hair specialists** in Dhaka who treat hair fall properly and guide patients with these medications?\n\nI just want to get some honest opinions and maybe find the right doctor who can help me recover whatever hair is still possible to save.\n\nThanks in advance",

        "title": "My Story",
        "body": "I’m a 21-year-old boy. My father has schizophrenia. After I was born, my mother couldn’t breastfeed me. I’m the first child in the family, and when I was four years old, my little sister was born. My mother became very busy with her, and I didn’t get the time or care I needed.\n\nWhen I was a child, I used to spend most of my days outside, playing with my friends. They felt more like my family than anyone else. I would visit their houses and stay out until evening.\n\nWhen I was about seven or eight, I started to learn swimming. One day, some pond water got stuck in my ear and caused a terrible infection. My ear began to rot from the inside, and it was extremely painful. My father refused to let me take antibiotics, so for days I suffered before being treated with homeopathic medicine.\n\nWhen I was nine, my parents decided to move away. Leaving my friends behind broke my heart. The new place was quiet and lonely. I stayed home most of the time, surrounded by my parents’ constant fights. My father often left the house early in the morning and came back very late—or sometimes not until the next day. My mother would yell all day and curse him. Both of them worked as primary school teachers. I felt trapped in their arguments, and I often thought about dying.\n\nAfter finishing 10th grade, I left home to live with my maternal uncle in the capital city. I couldn’t really share my feelings with anyone.\n\nDuring my final year of high school, my father was admitted to the hospital for open-heart surgery. I visited him several times between HSC exams. His surgery went well, and he returned home, but he remained weak and struggled to breathe. Around that time, one of my aunts suddenly died of a heart attack, which shocked everyone.\n\nWhile my father was recovering, I wanted to return to Dhaka for my studies, but he was too ill. My mother and I argued a lot. My mind was exhausted—I couldn’t rest, and I couldn’t focus on studying. After more conflict with my mother, I finally returned to Dhaka and joined a coaching center to prepare for the engineering admission exams.\n\nPreparing for those exams is hard as we know. At my uncle’s house, there were problems too. I was moved into the drawing room to study and sleep, and I couldn’t concentrate at all. I cried to my mother for help, but she didn’t respond—she was overwhelmed with my father’s illness. My uncle’s family, meanwhile, was celebrating the birth of a new child. While I was struggling and crying for help, there was laughter all around the house.\n\nEver since I was little, I loved machines. I always wanted to be an engineer. My mother knew this. I used to take apart my toys and gadgets to see how they worked—flashlights, radios, even a television. I started learning programming (Python) when I was in class nine. But my parents and relatives all wanted me to become a doctor. They kept pressuring me, and I couldn’t study properly.\n\nEventually, I took the engineering admission exam but couldn’t get a good rank. I wasn’t surprised, because I hadn’t been able to study properly through all that stress. Still, there was one more chance—a central exam for 24 universities. I studied hard for a month and did well in the test. But in the end, I failed because of corruption in the system. That's another story.\n\nNow I’m studying Computer Science and Engineering at a private university. In my first semester, I achieved a CGPA of 4.00 out of 4.00. I’m doing well academically, but I often feel depressed when I think about my life. I have no real family bond, I’m not in a top public university, I don’t earn any money, and I never received the love or care I needed from my parents.\n\nSometimes it feels like I have nothing.\n\n  \nThe story is mine, just written in plain English using chatgpt and some edits by me.",

Pakistan also increasingly has soft power in Bangladesh due to their cricket team and many women wanting Pakistani man.\n\nWhy doesn’t Bangladesh develop soft power strategy. Given it is a clothing exporter powerhouse they can develop soft power in fashion like Japan did. Today, people go to France or Japan for shopping because the value is in the branding and design, not just production. I myself shopped in Japan and went to their stores like Uniqlo. When someone sees Tiger or Mizuno shoes they associate with Japan, and France with LVMH. There is no reason Bangladesh can’t develop aspirational clothing brands with the supply chain they have. Bangladesh in addition to West Bengal was the textile capital of world so tradition is there. \n\nSecond thing is cricket. Sport is a great way of showing soft power. Thats why Saudi is throwing money at football and the Qataris and Emiratis sponsor so many leagues. Today, people worship England because they have EPL. People love Spain because they have Barcelona and Real Madrid. Cricket is second most popular sport in the world so Bangladesh should develop its T20 League with a clear cultural EXPORTING strategy. Just like Manchester United have overseas fans and plays exhibition matches abroad Bangladesh teams such as Dhaka Capitals and Khulna Tigers should do the same and develop global following in cricket playing nations. \n\nThese are just two ideas I have. \n\n",

My plan is to get admitted to the Physics department of the University of Dhaka (where I live) and do my undergrad there. For postgrad, I want to do my master's degree and PhD in theoretical physics at a top university abroad. I want to build my career in research and/or teaching theoretical physics. \n\nSince there is basically zero opportunity for physics graduates in my country, I plan to move abroad for my career. To go through with my plan, I would need a fully funded scholarship for my Master's and PhD, as it's impossible for me to pay for education abroad. Unfortunately I don't have much idea about scholarships. If anyone can help me with what scholarships I could apply for and what opportunities they could be for me, that would be greatly appreciated. I'll also have 4 years ahead of me before my Master's, so I think that's enough time to prepare myself. So basically I need help with the idea of a roadmap. Suggestions on scholarship programmes I could apply for is also appreciated. I'm very dedicated to this goal, so I'd be very grateful to anyone who helps out, thanks 🙏",

But step inside, and the contrast is shocking. Officers sleep on rusty metal beds packed together inside suffocating rooms where even ceiling fans cannot be installed because the ceiling is too low. Case files are prepared sitting on beds because there are no desks. Bags are stacked on stairwells, walls are damp, the rooms are cramped, and pest control is a fantasy. Bedbugs bite them at night, mosquitoes during the day. Forty-two men share two toilets. There are no cleaners; officers clean the floors themselves after 12–14 hours of duty before they are allowed to rest.\n\n**The problem is not limited to Banani.** At Shah Ali Police Station in Mirpur 1, the situation is worse. There is no kitchen, so constables must eat outside, spending a quarter of their salary just to survive. There is not enough space to sleep. Some officers sleep on mosque verandas, some in community centers, and during busy weeks, many sleep on footpaths. Privacy doesn’t exist. A constable says he cannot even speak to his family over the phone at night because there is nowhere quiet to stand. There is also no rest area for reserve police officers—they sit outside for hours on chairs or rickshaws waiting for their shift to start.\n\n**These conditions are not just humiliating**—they affect policing. When a person is exhausted, living in heat, sleeping among insects, and working without rest, **can we really expect them to remain patient, professional, and morally firm every day?** We talk about police misconduct and corruption, but we never ask what happens when a system breaks a person down.",

People watched, filmed, and scrolled later.\n\nThis incident highlights the wider reality for women in Bangladesh: public transport can be unsafe, and many women spend extra money on private rides just to feel secure. According to BRAC's *Safe Roads for Women* report (2018), 94% of Bangladeshi women have faced harassment—verbal, physical, or otherwise—on public transport. A 2022 survey by UNDP, NHRC, and CRI found that 87% of women across 24 districts have been harassed at least once in their lives.\n\nBut this young woman fought back with a sandal, standing her ground. She represents millions who cannot: women who shrink in their seats, clench their fists in fear, and remain silent because speaking up often brings more scrutiny.",

Police stations cannot function with their current budget. Officers are sent to investigate murders with only Tk 6,000 from the government, when the **real cost is at least five times higher**. In one case, recovering a decomposed body in Ashulia cost Tk 9,100 before the investigation even began. The sub-inspector had to pay from his own pocket.\n\nBecause there isn’t enough allocation from the state, many police stations now survive through what officers openly describe as **“special funds.”** These funds are created through unofficial channels—*donations from businessmen, local political elites, and money taken from people who are desperate to get their cases moved forward or suspects released after bail. This doesn’t just create corruption*—**it makes corruption a requirement to keep police stations running**.\n\n**In Dhaka,** a police station receives Tk 40,000 a month as source money for operations, but spends over Tk 80,000 a month simply giving refreshments to daily visitors, many of whom are political figures. The station needs around Tk 1.5 lakh a month for basic supplies like paper, fuel, bulbs, toilet cleaners, and maintenance, but receives only a fraction of that every four months. Even detainees legally get Tk 30 per meal, but a basic meal today costs almost three times more. Police often end up feeding them from their own salaries to prevent starvation.\n\nVehicles are old and barely functional, making it impossible to respond to emergencies quickly. Fuel allocations are so low that officers sometimes rent private vehicles just to conduct operations. Officers admit the truth: they cannot meet public expectations because the system forces them to beg for funds informally. This is how integrity breaks—not always by personal greed, but by structural design.\n\n**Reform proposals already exist.** The Police Reform Commission has recommended more investigation funds, better operational budgets, a transparent audit system and direct funding for superintendents. But nothing changes if no one pays attention. ",

He was found the next day, October 23, in the Helipad area of Panchagarh Sadar Upazila, **chained to a tree by his leg and in a naked state**. Local residents discovered him and informed the police, who rescued him and admitted him to Panchagarh Adhunik Sadar Hospital.  \nMuhibullah claimed he was **abducted in an ambulance, tortured overnight**, and that he had been receiving **anonymous threat letters** before the incident. Some Islamic groups have protested in Panchagarh and demanded the arrest of those responsible.\n\n**When speaking to journalists** from his hospital bed, [Mufti Muhibullah provided a detailed account of his alleged abduction](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1D4osQWsEe/) and the motives behind it. He claimed that around 7 AM on October 22, while he was out for a walk after Fajr prayer, **five men** in an ambulance forced him inside by covering his face. He alleged that they then subjected him to **inhumane torture**, including being stripped, severely beaten with a water-filled bottle on his thighs, and having his beard shaved off. He stated the five men spoke **\"standard Bengali\"** but did not sound like Bangladeshis, and they threatened to harm all Islamic scholars.\n\nHe claimed his abduction was the culmination of **months of threats** delivered via anonymous letters. According to his statements and the First Information Report (FIR) filed later, these letters, allegedly from \"ISKCON terrorists,\" demanded that he preach in his mosque sermons:\n\n1. In favor of **Akhand Bharat** (Undivided India).\n2. In support of the release of **ISKCON leader Chinmoy Das**.\n3. Against **Islam-based political parties, BNP, and NCP**.\n4. A **fatwa** stating that there is no barrier to love between **Muslim girls and Hindu boys**.\n5. To **stop using the words Allah, Muhammad, and Islam** in the mosque.\n\nHe alleged the letters promised him a **large sum of money (crores of rupees)** if he complied, or threatened him and his family with death and harm if he refused.\n\nFollowing the widespread outcry over the alleged abduction and torture, particularly with Islamic groups in Panchagarh staging protests against ISKCON, an investigation was launched. \n\n**However,** subsequent findings have cast serious doubt on Mufti Muhibullah's claims, leading [police to place him under investigation](https://www.kalerkantho.com/online/national/2025/10/24/1596268). Several CCTV camera footage from the area and time he claimed to have been abducted show Muhibullah Miaji **walking quickly by himself**, but there is **no footage of anyone forcibly picking him up** or of an ambulance stopping to take him away.\n\nDespite claiming to have been tortured for nearly a day and a night, Muhibullah was observed to have **returned to normal life** and gave a speech to his congregation shortly after being released from the hospital. The content and language of the anonymous letters he produced also raised suspicions. Critics pointed out that the letters contain a mix of seemingly contradictory devotional terms (\"[Jagat Joyi Kalimata\" and \"Buddhadev](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BUY8f2pty/)\") and use words like **\"Adhikarik\"** which he himself noted is **not standard Bangladeshi official language**.\n\nAfter these inconsistencies came to light, Mufti Muhibullah was **interrogated by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)** and later admitted to a hospital in Dhaka, becoming unavailable for further comment.",

However, many of the teachers there often seem to endorse Jamaat and its narratives. I also found out fairly recently that all two of the room execs that I knew were Shibir-spawns in their college-uni era\n\nDuring the recent Indo-Pak clash, one lecturer made some pretty explicit remarks, things like *“Pakistan is our brother nation,” “The fall of Islamabad means the fall of Dhaka,”* and *“India opposes Jamaat because it’s the only true patriotic force around.”* (-\\_-)  \nI strongly despised those comments. I brought it up in the student TG group to see how others felt, and it honestly sent shivers down my spine to see almost everyone supporting that lecturer’s stance. I went on a rant about Jamaat’s war crimes during ’71 and so on and soon after, the channel admin locked the chat and asked everyone to refrain from making political remarks.\n\nSo what do y'all make of **RETINA**?",

I rarely went out unless there was a specific reason, and my parents weren’t financially well-off enough to take me to different places or restaurants.\n\nNow that I’m 20, I feel completely clueless about restaurants, good tourist spots, or how to socialize, since I still don’t have any friends. I also lack good social and dressing skills. I’m still broke, but I don’t want to continue living such a lonely and miserable life. How can I improve in these areas?",

        "title": "Jobless for 10 months now.. Anyone else going through a similar struggle?",
        "body": "Hello everyone, or at least anyone that's reading this. I'm not sure how to structure this post properly, but it will probably read more like a rant than anything else. I'm just looking to kinda scream into the void.\n\nI'm 27 now. I got my first job at the age of 14, which was a creative writing job. I don't remember all too well, but it was a very underpaid job which was like 1200 words was $3 or something. Didn't really mind. Game is game.\n\nAnd that's where I started my freelancing journey. It probably needs to be emphasized that I didn't have a normal childhood, I was taken off education at an early age of 11, so I spent the rest of my time getting better at English, computers and just general internet literacy. I was lucky enough to have had a Pentium 4 with a 1 GB RAM computer that was handed down to me and I remember struggling so much to run even basic programs.. but it got me started and kept me going when I had nowhere else to go.\n\nFast forward a few years, I become more proficient at English and general tasks, and take on transcription and translation based jobs. While supporting what little I can for my little dysfunctional family (Mom, little brother, me). Due to constantly being under financial stress, we probably had to move homes I would say.. a total of 25-30 times until now? Anyway.. I guess I made what I had Infront of me as a career and this gave me a chance to work at Augmedix when I was 18. 25k job. Though I hadn't gotten in for their scribing project, it was a different project at the time which was an annotation project (code based transcription for AI training), but since it was a temporary experimental project it was shut off after 6 months, and me? Laid off. I didn't have the educational qualifications needed for their scribing department and it was a requirement.\n\nSo I set my gaze on online jobs and came across Amazon Mechanical Turk. With the help of a boro bhai, I was able to set up a computer in US that we remotely used to.. well, work on the tasks on the platform. The person in US did take a small cut, but it was negligible. I would make around 5-10 dollars a day by working for 12-14 hours which probably wasn't a whole lot, but it did keep me afloat for a long time pretty much until 2020.\n\nHonestly the pandemic era wasn't so bad for me, I barely used to go out anyway so it hadn't been much of a change for me, however what was a change was the influx of jobs in the market. A lot more work started to become available online and people weren't super focused on educational aspects, and this landed me a great job at Appen (now called CrowdGen). It was a Bengali transcription job, and seeing my effort and good English, I was quickly made into a project manager. Pay was $2.5 an hour. I was ecstatic. But good things never last too long. At least not in my case. By the time I was done paying all debts around us and just started experience \"shochcholota\" this project too was abruptly taken off at the 5 months mark.\n\nAfter this I fell back into the same place again and well, went back to Amazon Mechanical Turk. Earned whatever I could, and started picking up some video editing skills though my PC wasn't really capable of keeping up with it. I tried many call center jobs too in the middle of this, but I.. I don't know why, but I feel debilitated when it comes to working in call centers. I never fared well, no matter how many times I tried. I became deathly depressed to the point I would rather take my life instead of working in another call center.\n\n2022 rolls on, and due to the rise of AI, Amazon Mechanical Turk slowly started to lose all it's microtasks and this resulted in.. well, becoming homeless. Me, my little brother and my mom, we spent an entire month on the streets. We used to somehow spend nights in various hospital lobbies and benches, parks, even spent a few nights at Kamalapur station. Probably the darkest days of life and my family. My little brother fell off a rickshaw and ended up being hurt really badly to the point he couldn't move one of his leg. This prompted me to ask for help desperately from all the friends I knew. And one of them did help me out. His parents were incredibly kind souls and helped us out with almost 20k worth of money, not counting how they helped with food, clothes, and even mugs and plates. We managed to get a tiny \"chilekotha\" room for 8k a month, but even that felt so relieving. We finally had a place to stay after being on the streets for an entire month. I remember spending the new year (2023) on the roof of that house and feeling free.\n\nWhile living in this tiny place, I tried one last time to work in a call center where the pay was genuinely good at $3 per hour, but by the end of the second week I was throwing up everyday before my shift from anxiety, I was having constant panic breakdowns during calls, and.. yeah. I couldn't bring in the results they had hoped for, as well as my deteriorating call quality because we only had a single room. We actually had to go out to take a shower, the stove was in the exact same room we slept in, there was no way to wash the dishes other than taking it downstairs, it wasn't really a convenient place for a job that requires you to work at night in a quiet environment. But I still l wish I somehow could've rewired my brain to work at this place. Anyway.. So I went onto search more jobs and through the help of a mutual, I landed another job as a dispatcher for a US transportation company that operated from Bangladesh. Pay wasn't great, only 25k and I had to travel from Mohammadpur to Uttara to work, but.. it was still work.\n\nI actually had help from this r/Dhaka in 2023 where I explained my situation and how important it is for me to move to Uttara for my job after the horrible situation we had been in, and well, how our quality of life was in that chilekotha. I then moved to Uttara 18 (RUAP) with the help of the people from this sub as well as my boss from the workplace. It felt so amazing to live in a flat again, haha.\n\nSo.. I don't know what it is, whether I'm just a bad luck charm or my fate is just meant to be horrible, the company I mentioned I was working in? They had to downscale drastically after I was working 4 months there. In the beginning, the person who hired me did so because he couldn't handle the amount of work he had. We were handling the dispatching of 6 trucks. By the time the 4th month rolled around, one of the driver crashed and went out of business, the main contractor (4 trucks) got kicked out of his company and that turned into a single truck, and the other driver became less regular at his work due to health issues. So after cutting down my pay to 15k, he just couldn't afford keep me anymore so well, I got laid off once more at the 6th month.\n\nWe started getting pushed down by debts once more, 3 months of rent became due and that's when the best job until now came along. Actually I got my contract just 2 weeks prior to our civil war. It was a job from TelusDigital, but they were being subcontracted by Bytedance. Basically, we were working on the algorithm for TikTok Bangladesh. My first lakh-taka job. Though the process rigorous in itself, I still passed all of their insane tests with flying colors and even helped 3 other pass. I was the best performer in the job for 18 weeks straight. I was happier than I had ever been. 5$ per hour, 1 year contract, I was convinced I would get out of my situation as long as I diligently worked at this role.\n\nBut yup, you probably guessed it at this point, their AI/algorithm was ready at the 6 months point and they laid off everyone despite the 1 year contract. I couldn't really save any money either because I paid off the dues from before, and bought a fridge, some basic household items, and a laptop for my little brother. When I was laid off, I did pay 4 months of rent in advance, but we started struggling to have even basic meals. In this time, I tried whatever I could do, content creation, learning to code, making a SaaS, graphics design, nothing panned out. Luckily through the help of an old friend from Augmedix, my little brother (16) managed to find a job of his own. He is working in the making EMRs (Electronic medical records) for doctors in the US, and I couldn't be prouder of him. It pays only 20k, but he's doing what I haven't been able to in the past.. 9 months now.\n\nThe thing is that.. the debt has piled on so much now that we've been told by the house owner to move out next month if we can't pay off the dues. And I'm deathly scared of landing on the streets somehow again. My little brother doesn't earn enough for us to move, advance, and find another new place. I shouldn't even be relying on his income anyway, but I've probably applied to over hundreds of places now without anything panning out. Experience doesn't mean anything if you don't have an education.\n\nAnd I guess that's my TED talk, guys. My life and struggles so far has amounted to absolutely nothing. I'm just a nobody failure, and it honestly hurts. The only reason I don't give up is because I can't give up. My mother and my brother doesn't have anyone but me. I can't bear to see them suffer, my mother crying from hearing all the debters saying horrible shit, my brother not being able to sleep in peace because he feels like we'll become homeless again.. I am supposed to be their beacon of light, yet I'm just.. fucking useless.\n\nAh man.. Anyone going through a similar struggle of being jobless?",

Also there is a long distance trauma.She texted me for 1month non stop even after i aggressively told her to fuckoff.At last seeing so much desperated txt,i told her to meet me,then i will see.She came on march 27🙂She is an angel,literally my dream girl.We talked,before leaving i asked her to hold her hand,she gave away without a second thought. Btw that was my first ever sitting with a girl on a date.I fell for her.After some days she shared she had a relationship for 2years. Her bf cheated so she left.I asked her if she was physical,she said no,convinced me.I did let it go saying everyone has a past.\n\nWe were in deep love for 4months.She was sweet af,did everything possible for a gf in long distance. She supported me,cared for me on insane level.She texted gm every morning.Used to call me to wake me up for uni.Sometimes while talking she used to share her past relationship stories.I used to get insecured at that moments.I never had relationship before,all my life i was a decent, academically sound student.I was busy in studies.I also studies in one of the most reputed Engineering uni,also in top dept.Anyway,insecurity was silly.Like someone had her type feeling. On a night while talking, she suddenly started sharing her ex did this,playing victim while we were talking about us, our future.I was disturbed.Also about this time i get to know her frnd circle 🙂Most of her frnds were non virgin,almost everyone. Even some had abortion.I was in doubt how can she not have sex in 2years?She even justified things like \"sex krlei sarajibon eksathe thaka lagbe emon na\",\" sex to mistake\" while talking abt her frnds.After sharing id pass i went to her story archive saw her male frnds and past relationship stories.She went to movie date(one day she told me she knows wht people do in movie date),i saw her male frnds kole niye chobi tulse,she story dicche proudly🙂also so many male interactions,male frnds stories.I saw in her messenger she was telling a frnd she did visit her ex even after 1year of their brkup,she received gift from him.She dated multiple boys after brkup🙂\nI was shocked.I never expected this.Now i think all the desperation she showed was not love,was to bag a good guy,to get rid of her past.The insecurities that she had sex grew up so fast🙂i ended that relation forcefully, now im broke.I feel nothing about the world.I gave her my whole heart,i even fixed my marriage with her we planned everything 🙂I just cant sleep now.She was my first love,my only love.I had so many things to do in plan when she will come to dhaka.Everything is gone.What can i do🙂Should i go back to her or let this go.",

What do people cook for weddings, holidays, or big gatherings?\n\n5️⃣ How is food usually **served or eaten** — banana leaves, metal plates, clay dishes, hands?

How would you describe the atmosphere?\n\n1️⃣2️⃣ What does **hospitality** mean in Bangladeshi culture? Are there sayings, customs, or gestures tied to sharing food?\n\n1️⃣3️⃣ Do you know any **restaurants, cafés, food trucks, or delivery places** that serve *real Bangladeshi food* outside Bangladesh — especially in Russia or Europe?\n\n1️⃣4️⃣ If you’ve been there — **what dish or flavor stuck with you the most**, and why?\n\n1️⃣5️⃣ And lastly — **what feeling do you associate with Bangladeshi food?**  \nIs it comfort, heat, noise, family, chaos, or something else entirely?\n\n\n\n💬 Any stories, photos, memories, or links will be a huge help for my research.  \nThank you so much in advance for sharing your experience ❤️",

What was supposed to be a smooth five-hour journey turned into a distressing experience because of one extremely rude and disrespectful passenger.\n\nAs soon as I boarded, I placed my two hand luggage bags in the overhead compartment. Immediately, a man started shouting at me, saying things like:\n\n“Why are you putting your bag on my side? Where will I put mine?”\n\nI calmly explained that there was enough space in the middle compartment and even offered to help him with his bag. Instead of accepting help, he continued yelling and refused to listen.\n\nAt first, I ignored his behaviour, but it quickly escalated. He aggressively removed my luggage from the compartment without my consent and shockingly began insulting my mother with disgusting, sexist language.\n\nAt that point, I stood up and confronted him — no one should ever tolerate such disrespect, especially towards women. Thankfully, the cabin crew and nearby passengers intervened before the situation got worse.\n\nThe Emirates crew handled the issue professionally and supported us throughout. We filed an official complaint so that the airline could keep a record of his behaviour for future flights.\n\nThis post isn’t just about one rude passenger — it’s about the bigger issue of misogyny, aggression, and lack of respect that too often goes unchecked, especially on routes from South Asia. As frequent flyers, my mother and I believe no one should have to endure such verbal abuse in a civilised setting.\n\nI hope airlines continue to take stronger action to protect passengers — especially women — from harassment and verbal violence on flights Emirates",

Why is that?”\n\nI made that post because I’d seen a few videos where Indians were claiming Muslin as an Indian fabric.\n\nFor those who don’t know, Muslin is a fabric that originated in Dhaka. It’s extremely fine, almost see-through, and so delicate that an entire saree can pass through a ring.\n\nSo a in India a list was made of fabrics \nAnd muslin was there .\n\n\n\nAnd I realized this isn't the first time or the first person who had done this \n\nThen I saw another post about saree being a purly indian garment \n\n\n\nOk so in the comment section of my post \n\n\nTheir logic was that since Bangladesh was founded in 1971, something thousands of years old couldn’t possibly belong to Bangladesh.\n\nSo I replied, “By that logic, nothing belongs to India either, since India was formed in 1947.”\n\nThat’s when they became enraged. They started saying things like “Bangladesh destroyed itself,” “it’s a failed state,” and other disrespectful comments. Many used very offensive language.\n\nBasically, they don’t follow their own logic. To them, anything desi automatically belongs to India.\n\nBefore today, I used to think India wasn’t that bad, and that we all belonged to the same subcontinent. I didn’t understand the hate.\n\nBut now, I do.\n\nBefore this experience, I only knew a few Indians — my friends — and I mistakenly thought all Indians were like them.\n\nIndians are just a bunch of entitled idiots (obviously there are some exceptions)\n",

About a week ago, the retailer called to say the battery had been serviced and returned from the manufacturer, and that it would be delivered to Sylhet on Saturday or Sunday. Unfortunately, no delivery was made. Since then, they’ve stopped responding — they don’t reply on WhatsApp, they cancel calls, and I think they may have even blocked me.\n\nI work abroad, so I can’t visit the shop myself. My relative called them, they initially spoke to him but now they cancel his calls.  I could ask someone to visit the shop on my behalf, but it would mean a long trip from Sylhet to Dhaka.\n\nWhat are my options here? Has anyone experienced something similar, or can suggest the best way to deal with this? I’m worried they may just ignore us now and avoid delivering the product altogether.\n\nThank you.",

The thing is though I don't want to make the kind of video where I just say 'Dhaka is crazy', I want to draw out the hidden gems, local history or cool places to hang out. \n\nHere are some videos I made last time-https://youtu.be/zTyGT4XsxmE\n\nIf you are willing, please recommend me some places to research for any future videos and hopefully I can make a fair and exciting video.

I do not know what the actual situation is - and I know that our media has peddled a lot of lies, and tried to exaggerate the situation, invent a 'genocide', and so on. Yet, it is a fact that the population of Hindus has declined a lot due to exodus, and there are many legitimate concerns - like land-grabbing, and these occasional riots and disturbances, homes and businesses burnt, and so on. \n\nAny attack on Bengali Hindus, would be a blow to Indian Muslims. It would convince the Hindus here, that we are treacherous fanatics, waiting for our opportunity to persecute them. There is already a feeling that wherever Muslims become a majority, it is impossible for minorities to live among them. \n\nThe reaction of such incidents is also borne by Bengali Muslims in India - in the form of mass detentions, arrests, eviction drives, and home demolitions (as are recently being seen in Assam).\n\nOf course, beside this, it is the humanitarian and legal duty to maintain peace, and provide the fullest religious freedom to all Minorities. \n\nDurga Puja is almost here, I pray that it happen in perfect peace, proving the nobility of our Community and our sincere wish to live in Peace with the Hindus. Amen\n\n\n\n",

The choices are pretty similar it seems when i compare to india with their more good looking ebikes. So is there any chance that we get ola or athers like brand in bangladesh.\n4.

        "body": "The DUCSU 2025 election took place on 9th September 2025, and the results are out. Shibir's landslide victory in the election surprised most people, and many are still struggling to accept it. This is just my personal analysis and observation of the election. To be frank, I am very much anti-Shibir ideologically, but I do congratulate them on their victory because this is how democracy should work. Perhaps I will garner downvotes from both sides, but putting that aside, here is an attempt to analyze the event and the aftermath objectively.\n\n# Analysis\n\nThis was the first DUCSU election since 2019. Out of approximately 39,775 registered students, an impressive [\\~75%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_DUCSU_election#Vice-President_election) cast their votes. Shibir won by a huge margin in the top three posts - Vice President, General Secretary, and Assistant General Secretary. Out of the remaining 12 posts in the central committee, [Shibir won 9 seats](https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/7shgm6t3ll), and independent candidates won 3 seats. Out of the 15 seats in the central committee, there are 13 more seats. Shibir won in 11 of them, 1 was won by an independent candidate, and the other by a leftist candidate.\n\n[https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/2025\\_DUCSU\\_election#Vice-President\\_election](https://preview.redd.it/8dp92i0doeof1.png?width=676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=662a72bb59b9d70e00946f92c0931b44c7b8d3c7)\n\nInitially, many candidates like [Abid](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/ddaaksu-nirbaacn-kaarcupir-abhiyog-aabidsh-dui-praarthiir) from Chatra Dal, [Umama](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/yr9ll5lv3u), Meghmallar, and [Abdul Kader](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/798953r10n), called the election a fraud and denounced it. It should be noted that there were indeed several issues, discrepancies, and mishaps during the election. But it seems these were in the minority, and it is [unlikely to have impacted the election results significantly](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/jtegu85p55). It is [not rational](https://www.facebook.com/kallol.mustafa/posts/pfbid0BhqJRAfxujZ42gZbM7pXvCdakaD79z66ciw1dga2sPTTfaWfrT8wA7UycX9L6paml) to make claims of election engineering without strong evidence. However, controversies in JUCSU and [such claims](https://www.facebook.com/kazijesinbd/posts/pfbid035hT9mSugPNNK7rDh9yfQjdFn5b3Q1v8SEgAYrrzmxYwP5Wj3UqTQm1LswemrJtQbl) do have some merit and perhaps we should also attempt to find out the answer to [these questions](https://www.facebook.com/meghmallar.bosu/posts/pfbid02tv7bpyJAYRWTJRp2znJNh9iM9ycFLU51ZzFzTCKSyfRpK12An8HthGEnQif964Yrl).\n\nBut it seems likely that it was a fair election which Shibir won. This leads us to the next point - understanding how that outcome came about. As I said, I am ideologically strongly anti-Shibir, but to counter their ideology, we need to understand the problem and how it happened first. Below, I outline and rank these factors in order of importance.\n\n**Clean Positive Image, Welfare-based Politics, And Humility**\n\nAs surprising as it might sound, this seems to be the [biggest reason](https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/g9wby5oaqm) to me. The Shibir candidates have a strong positive image on campus. Shadik Kayem, who became the VP, is also one of the leaders of the July Movement. Shibir also actively did welfare-based politics - helped poor students, organized career training and programs, various social welfare, and [innovative ideas](https://www.facebook.com/saerzulkarnain/posts/pfbid0Yeo87r6h2Fh2eTgbsX69ww1hUptMSsdvmo9F8MwqBthZb78VLK5YdniysPCraK6yl). Chatra Dal and the leftist organizations fall behind significantly on these aspects, at least when considering scale and dedication.\n\nShibir were humble and genuine throughout the campaign and even [after victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMmbVbQaDFA). People do not like arrogance and attitude, especially after a mass uprising. You can question their intent and ideology all you want, but there is no doubt that this is the perception they were able to create with their actions.\n\n**Frustration With Other Political Parties And Weak Opposition**\n\nChatra Dal is stupid, frankly speaking, and does not have their priorities right. It is quite easy to see through their superficial acts and rhetoric. NCP is very controversial, divided, and arrogant. If NCP were not so controversial and divided, it could have participated in the election united and also would have garnered tons of votes from the swing voters. The independent candidates were good, which is why they won 5 seats and got many votes, but they also don't have the political strength and backing. Therefore, many students were unsure and could not rely on their promises and how much they would be able to deliver, despite their goodwill.\n\nAs for the leftists, it's a bit different. When there is an injustice, leftist organizations are usually the first to take a stand against it, and this is great. But what about the common daily struggles of the students? Imagine a poor student outside of Dhaka struggling. He/she finds solace when Shibir bonds with them, shares spiritual stuff, helps them with career development, provides food, etc. What do the leftist parties do? Leftist parties mean well and promise changes, but in practice, they fall short in terms of delivering them to the common students via structured campaigns and activities. Left-aligned individuals are nice and often help others, but this gets associated mostly on a personal level and not with an ideology/party. Whereas in the case of Shibir, the party benefits because of its structure and strategy. The leftist parties do have their limitations despite good intentions. For example, they do not have much funding. On the other hand, Shibir is very organized and has access to large funds from various sources.\n\n**Organization Structure And Campaign Strategy**\n\nShibir is methodical, organized, united by a common ideology, and recruits/grooms meritorious students from an early age. They have been preparing for DUCSU for more than a year. Their door-to-door campaign and interaction with students were nothing short of remarkable. While others were busy playing checkers, they played chess. It's a long-term game, and they were very focused on their goals and pursued them methodically.\n\n**Social Acceptance**\n\nThe two biggest criticisms of Shibir are being anti-1971 and being extremists. They [still are](https://www.shibir.org.bd/center/uploaded/CONSTITUTION%20book_Final_2024.pdf) in many ways, but they have managed to convince a large part of their members and supporters, and also the swing voters otherwise. As for 1971, they never disown or condemn the roles of their predecessors but diplomatically pay tribute to the freedom fighters and the liberation war. It is very questionable and ambiguous at best, but combine that with the rise of anti-1971 propaganda (not necessarily from Shibir) and how BAL used, distorted, and sold 1971 to justify their crimes, Shibir succeeded in creating an illusory image that the present generation of Shibir is not anti-1971 and should not have to bear the crimes of their ancestors.\n\nAs for extremism, they have managed to trick others with deception and manipulation. They have many intellectuals like Mirza Ghalib who are not extremists in the traditional sense and often justify their fundamentalism and problematic policies with diplomacy and word salad. With the intellectuals and social media activists, they were able to portray themselves as liberal democrats with a mix of religious/ethical dedication in the eyes of many.\n\n**Vote Splits**\n\nI would have ranked it much higher had Shibir not won by a huge margin. Notice that a significant portion of the people still voted against Shibir. For the [VP post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_DUCSU_election#Vice-President_election), there were four other good candidates, and the votes were split across them.\n\n**Rise Of Fundamentalism**\n\nNo doubt that fundamentalism and right-wing politics have risen in Bangladesh. There are many reasons for this, not diving deep here for now. It is important to note that many Islamic parties and right-wing individuals are strongly against Shibir. But nonetheless, a significant part sympathizes with Shibir. And due to their somewhat aligned goals and hatred for liberal democracy and leftists, it is likely they voted for Shibir.\n\n**Victimhood**\n\nShibir was oppressed by BAL for years. BAL also normalized attacking or even killing people by tagging them as \"Shibir\". For example, the murder of Abrar Fahad. It didn't matter if they did Shibir or not. When you oppress a group like this, you end up making them victims and martyrs. And naturally, people sympathize with them.\n\n**Liberal Hypocrisy And Elitism**\n\nWhen liberals remain silent as Hefazot is massacred in Shapla in 2013, when liberals blockade Shahbagh for weeks, and instead of demanding a fair and impartial trial, deliver the sentence themselves while chanting hateful and violent slogans, when liberals enable BAL's atrocities just because they believe there is a greater evil. When some liberals resort to [hateful acts](https://www.facebook.com/faisalxahmed01/posts/pfbid02QtrDVdh4hxxowJNNBJZ4MKp6NGRSY5q75FBw3EcdGaGT5S87ARd32dNN5kUS2ge2l), and the others are silent (is it much different from some fundamentalists doing hateful acts and moderates staying silent?). Do all these create a positive or negative branding about their values and ideologies? Heck, it does not matter how correct your ideologies or values are if your actions are like this.\n\nIs there a difference between \"kanke mage hejab koi???\" and \"Look at those brainless Hijabi KFC chickens simping over Shibir\"? Is the difference a matter of ideology or mentality? Hatred only brews more hatred, and before you know it, you end up becoming the monster you started to fight yourself. There is a difference between being strong and being a bigot. You could strongly make the point why you think the Hijab is a symbol of modesty and should be preferred, but not imposed. Or you could strongly make the point why you believe that the Hijab is a symbol of oppression due to how it is enforced and how women are conditioned. Instead of doing that, what are you achieving with hate? Do you want to see the world burning, or do you want to influence and change others to follow your values? Even if you are right rationally, what does it tell others about your values if your actions are hateful? Will you influence others or push them away?\n\nAnd no, it is not being diplomatic or always taking a non-binary stance. Some things **are binary**. If someone is against democracy, against human rights, you don't excuse that by taking a non-binary position. You stand against them firmly and fight it. You just don't have to become like them in the process.\n\nAll these things act like slow poisoning. It pushes people away. If a swing voter were considering voting for you, they would be repelled, and then they must choose between the lesser evil. Perhaps they agree with you on how the other side is so bad, but you pissed them off so bad with your elitism and hypocrisy that they would rather vote for the bad guys than you. This is literally [one of the biggest reasons](https://www.paulgraham.com/woke.html) why someone like Trump is in power in the US.\n\n# If Shibir Is So Good, Why Don't You...\n\nThat's a lovely question. Dr Zahed explains it much better than I can ever [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c113p8ewMUw). I also shared my reasoning earlier [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bangladesh/comments/1nauanz/%E0%A6%A1%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B8_%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%AC_%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%AF_%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%9A%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%9B%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%B0_%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95_%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%9F_%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%A8_%E0%A6%AF_%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%A3/). Shibir's politics is [identity politics](https://annas-archive.org/md5/15a5c6b4cc7c7b0ab75c99c9a3ae29c0), which always excludes instead of including everyone. BJP and Hindutva, Trump's white supremacism, Israel's Zionism, Jamaat's Islamism are all the same. History teaches us that nothing good ever comes out of it, no matter how charming they might seem initially.\n\nThey have the following in their constitution. They leave it purposefully vague so that when someone confronts them and questions how their goals are anti-democratic, they can twist their argument with word salad and mental gymnastics and argue how it's not. But one only has to look at the mainstream interpretations and wonder why they have so many details in their booklets, but they never specify how exactly democracy and democratic values will work in their system. They never clarify their interpretation of the religion and how they will use it to rule the country. It's bits and pieces to lure people with deception and manipulate them to gain their support. Hypocrisy and ambiguity everywhere, the perfect example of a wolf in sheep's clothing.\n\n\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.shibir.org.bd\\/center\\/uploaded\\/CONSTITUTION&amp;#37;20book\\_Final\\_2024.pdf \\(Page 10\\)](https://preview.redd.it/a1cspuwavlof1.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a964bf51858b76c154b673df74ffcd08d1e606)\n\nThey are against democracy, [against equal rights of men and women](https://youtu.be/LVONB0hdr0o?t=2710), and many universally accepted human rights. They seek to impose their perceived version of an Islamic Sharia, even though [most Islamic parties strongly oppose Jamaat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioXBubjsSao) in terms of ideology. They are a political party in a democratic system that seeks to come to power with democracy and trickery, and when they do come to power, they will destroy the very same democratic values themselves.\n\nJamaat supporters and sympathizers, does it sound absurd to some? Or is that what you want as well? Are you an extremist or just brainwashed? Don't believe me? Well, it's right in their damn [booklets](https://www.shibir.org.bd/center/uploaded/kormo_proddhoti.pdf) and [constitution](https://www.shibir.org.bd/center/uploaded/CONSTITUTION%20book_Final_2024.pdf). It's a dangerous philosophy and a recipe for disaster.\n\n# Aftermath\n\nWhile this won't significantly impact the upcoming election, it is likely to have a long-term domino effect and end up in one of two ways. While the BNP still appears likely to win the upcoming election, the contest will be far more competitive than many expected. In the longer term, however, the real test will be whether the leftists, liberals, and centrists can reform and rebuild their politics. BNP will also need to do the same. If this possibility happens, then there is a silver lining, and we have a chance.\n\nThe other possibility, which is also more likely, is that nobody learns anything, and this begins the first step towards us moving backwards. Right-wing parties and fundamentalist groups could re-emerge with renewed confidence. gaining political traction. Moral policing and harassment will increase. Over time, this trajectory could pave the way for a party like Jamaat to ascend to power. It wouldn’t necessarily mirror Afghanistan, but the state of human rights, especially for women and minorities, would deteriorate sharply. Economic growth would be stunted, international relations and trade would suffer, and the country could spiral toward anarchy, civil conflict, or even foreign intervention.\n\nThe fundamentalists and extremists are already delighted by this result, and they did not wait for long to start the shitshow - [Example 1](https://www.facebook.com/Anik0000/posts/pfbid02KyNgH6THnmgCHwozXBnwW49GEYCC1UaWnkr1dsdbd9WnsEsA9TF4VVSkboHXVUwBl), [Example 2](https://www.facebook.com/Anik0000/posts/pfbid02ur4gw68qA89dv5mdcM8WvxCjjMAMqSJCZPedvXatYGvw11FEGP5TM8tAZjpKjo6nl), [Example 3](https://www.facebook.com/arunimatahsin/posts/pfbid0ZRuAenSiH48G8UbUCNfCx67x6vxVPQfps2z5wrUSfvwKmGoTwCBcg7ptxQbHXBL6l), [Example 4](https://www.facebook.com/Anik0000/posts/pfbid02aCg9ZtdFKNcxNGFGYKzLsuit5advcCeJnPm2pPNnm4ej941ZjhJnbcWwNsuvnwpLl), [Example 5](https://www.facebook.com/parvezalambd/posts/pfbid02KcjVVZAnVGNDyoASjaLKAUcQhh3Eo3mcsKzuga6JmJ9d7daJcyVZsc9ko8Cb5DaUl). The rest will follow eventually.\n\nTo the voters who voted for Shibir - knowingly or unknowingly, you guys set the ball in motion. Either we will get a better r/bangladesh, or r/LeopardsAteMyFace is our future. Let's see what the future awaits.",

Now, I am planning to take this diploma rather than finding a new college to get admitted. It may sound stupid to some people for not finishing HSC, but if there is any possibility to study a BSc in Computer Science in Australia with a diploma, please help. I just want to get out of the Bangladeshi education system.\n\n\nBack story: Its my dream to be an engineer. as all we know in bangladesh, we have to take science for it. I took my SSC in science group and got A-. Took science in college too. Its a cantonment college btw. Maximum student failed on the final exam. Then the college make some exceptions for avarage students and took retake for the bad students, again maximum failed. But i was in the exception group. College gave use condition, after a 1.5 week there will be a CT (CLASS TEST) on 30 marks. Students have to pass 4 sub least. Also the principle added they will add extra class, after the college hours ends we can pick teacher who will take class on their subjects.\nMany days pass we didn't got the extra class but 2 teacher came forword and started the extra class with their own willpower. We only got 4 extra bio class and 2 extra chemistry class. At the time we were middel of the exam. Our result came i got 5 F and 2 pass. Many of my friends quickly Take TC and started their new college without the year gap.\nBtw In that college after this months ends the Pre-Test will start and their will be more student fall. Whats the point if they plan to cut off some student after CT if they want to cut now. \nThere is a huge resons why the college is doing this. For the new 1st year students the college incresed the seat number from dhaka board but there is no space for the extended seats they issued. We have 3 science sections  the day after the result the college combined 3 science section to 1 science section for the 2nd year. Left 2 free room for 1st year (newcome). Sometimes I wonder politics should learn politics from that college.",

I am currently an intern in a software company of Dhaka. \nI had a plan by the ending of HSC of moving abroad but covid came as an obstacle for me. Then I waited for ending my bsc. During university life, I also started to grow interest about BCS cadres. Their social acclamation and their acceptance in many areas made me interested to attempt BCS at least for once with full dedication. But then again All the dark realities of our country came to life as a flashback throughout this 3 to 4 years. I was fully determined to move abroad to master’s after my Bsc, but again something very drastic happened to our family. My father died this february. So now money came as a major issue for me. Yes , I can manage somehow but one thing bugging me is , If somehow moving to abroad with this huge investment consider as the worst result for me , What will I do then. \nSo, What should I do ? Should I try BCS for once and then try to pursue master’s ?\nOr should I try to move abroad for master’s?",

I've been always alone when dealing with life and low-key successfully dealt and executed my goals or chores(yes I had my failures but overcame figuring out myself). But now I cannot at all. I guess I am tired. Right now I'm at a point where it's crucial for me to try to become better(even be the best) but realized that I'm so burnt, so burnt that nothing is working for me. Funniest part in this I have no one to seek help from. I just don't know whom to approach, everybody around me knows I'm not doing well but they are not gonna actually help me out( I know this because I've shamelessly asked help from every possible people whom I thought could make time for me. But I guess everyone is busy in their lives :/) \n\nI want to go back to myself and help myself out but lacking the consistency and confidence I had . At this point I'm so scared that I don't even start doing basic things like cleaning my room because of me ending up ruining it again. Super weird I KNOW! \n\nTo Those I HAVE DEALT ACADEMICS AND JOBLIFE ALL ALONE AND CRACKING LIKE A BOSS HOW ARE YOU DOING IT? I NEED A START AND IM DESPERATE FOR IT. I've looked everywhere but amader desh er perspective ta jante chacchi. \n\nI'm not looking forward to making friends or anything anymore. Tried and literally doesn't work. ",

        "title": "What if Sam Hargrave's Extraction had a Bangladeshi cast",
        "body": "So stunt man turned director Sam Hargrave made a film called Extraction. It was based on a book called Ciudad (City in Spanish) as the setting was South American and therefore all the Asians in Extraction were based on South Americans.\n\nHowever for reason I cant find answers to. Sam decided to have the setting be Bangladesh, a South Asian Muslim majority country. He even hired Bangladeshi filmmaker Raffael Ahsan to translate the Bengali parts of the script to keep the language accurate too. The film was originally named Dhaka and was going to be entirely set in Bangladesh (minus Chris Hemsworth Australian scenes)\n\nHowever things fall apart when Ahsan found the cast were non-Bangladeshi and couldnt learn the language well enough. Casting director Sarah Halley Finn and Sam Hargrave denied Ahsans request to find Bangladeshi actors on the idea that none are famous enough to garner attention for the film. Add in the fact an Indian Producer was brought on and apparently made more changes possibly Saju and Ovi being Indian Hindus instead of Bangladeshi Muslims. It had lead to accusations of Islamophobia within the film purposely using Bangladesh as a Muslim country of faceless canon fodder.\n\nBut it got me thinking. What if Sam Hargrave took up Raffael Ahsan's suggestion? What if he decided to do what Gareth Evans did for Indonesia with the Raid and cast talented actor with ancestry from the country it was set? What Extraction was the Bangladeshi Raid?\n\nWell this is what Ive come up with if Extraction had a Bangladeshi led cast and still called Dhaka. Most of the characters would likely be renamed to fit the Bangladeshi actors heritage\n\nDana Abraham Hannan as Tyler Rake. Dana is a 6'2\" Dhaka born Canadian actor with n amateur boxing background. I chose him for his muscular build, tattoos and martial arts experience that would make him essentially resemble an Asian Chris Hemsworth. Id rename the character Tariq Rahim.\n\nAydin Ahmed as Ovi. Aydin is a British Bangladeshi child actor best known as Kevin Chipman in Deadpool and Wolverine. I felt that Ovi, his dad and Saju should be from Sylhet, Bangladesh instead of India. So British Bangladeshis would make sense for them as most British Bangladeshis are Sylheti. Aydin's dad Ifte Amed could easily play Ovi's Dad in the short prison scene Saju. Id rename the character Ali.\n\nJan Uddin as Saju. Jan is also a British Bangladeshi actor. With his fit build, long hair and 6'1\" stature. Id say he matches Randeep Hooda look. Jan was in Marvel Agents of Sheild as Isaiah and was Asimov Solensa in Cowboy Bebop. So he has some action experience. Sarah Finn Halley should be aware of him too as she regularly casts Marvel projects so how she didnt cast him for Extraction when he was in a Marvel show around the time he film was in preproduction is beyond me. Id rename the character Sajjid (tho Saj or Saju would be realistic nickname for a Sajjid)\n\nFarzana Due Elah as Nik Khan. Its not confirmed if Nik Khan is Bangladeshi. Her name which Im assuming is Anika \"Nik\" Khan wouldnt be out of place for a Bangladeshi. The sequel reveals she is French Bangladeshi which is not as common as British Bangladeshis or Italian Bangladeshis. But this is due to her original actress being French Iranian. I ld love to see if British Bangladeshi Farzana Dua Elahe could play an action girl role. She was in Our Girl as a Bangladeshi too. This characters name would be the same\n\nIslah Abdur Rahman as Yaz Khan. Yaz is Niks younger brother. He is a cameo at beat in the first film but more important in the second. Tho his actor is French Tunisian (thus making Nik and Yaz French Bangladeshis presumably), this versiom would British Bangladeshi like Islah Abdur Rahman. Rahman has experience in HwarangDo which would be great for Yaz Khans fight scenes, tho he onoy really had one in the sequel and almost died to a large mercenary woman after killing 2 of her men. Im assuming Yaz's full name is Yaseen \"Yaz\" Khan.\n\nChar Avell as Gaspar. For some reason Tylers only friend living in Dhaka is a massive American named Gaspar (Im assuming he is married to a Bangladeshi woman as he mentions a wife but she isnt seen so who knows). But I chose Char Avell as Gaspar as the singer is 6'3\" making him slightly taller than Dana (same way David Harbour is taller than Chris Hemsworth). It would mean this version of Gaspar would be a British Bangladeshi who has moved to Dhaka. Char has some acting experience from web series and once with the BBC series Coconut. But I can definitely see him do a short role like this. Gaspar would be renamed Ghazan.\n\nTaskeen Rahman as Asif Amir. Taskeen is a Bangladeshi actor (who he has lived in Australia quite a lot). Taskeen get typecast in Bangladesh for villain roles a lot due to his Blue Eyes. In Bangladesh light coloured eyes are called Shada Soke (White Eyes) and are seen as creepy or souless. Which is likely why Taskeen gets villain roles a lot.\n\nMahi Alam as Farhad. Mahi is a Bangladeshi American singer and actor best known for American Born Chinese as Anuj and the Mean Girl remake as Kevin Ganatra. So this would be the first time having him play a Bangladeshi.\n\nSaikat Ahamed as Colonel Sadik. Saikat Ahamed is a British Bangladeshi actor. I mostly chose him due to his age as Sadik is a older man and spends most of his action scenes Sniping. So Saikat can get into good shape for it. But doesnt need to be a crazy hand to hand fighter for this kinda role. Plus the head shot of him looks like he can pull off an aged and serious military man.\n\nIn addition to having Bangladeshis in the cast the plot will revolve around a corrupt goverment official from Dhaka (the original plan was Asif Amir is from a government family but Ahsan felt that was too contriversal tho recent events in Desh shows this to be accruate) will kidnapped the child of a Sylheti crime KingPin so that a Bangladeshi Canadian mercenary is sent in due to his firmiliarity to the city and its language. \n\nIf I could also add one more thing. Id get Grandmaster Mak Yuree to be the cultural advisor to the action scenes so that the Bangladeshis would be using the Bangladeshi martial art Butthan for the film same was The Raid had Indonesians using Pencakt Silat for that film just to show Bangladeshi Martial Arts in a big budget action film.\n\n",

একই যুক্তি কি এখানেও খাটে না? অতীতের দায়মোচন না করে যারা সামনে আগাতে চায়, তাদের ভরসা করা কতটুকু যৌক্তিক আর নৈতিক?\n\nআচ্ছা, এবার মুক্তিযুদ্ধ বাদ দিলাম। অন্য প্রসঙ্গে বলি। ইসলামী ছাত্রশিবির নিজেদেরকে একটি ইসলামী আদর্শভিত্তিক ছাত্রসংগঠন দাবি করলেও তাদের কার্যক্রমের মধ্য দিয়ে প্রায়ই চরমপন্থী ও উগ্র রাজনৈতিক প্রবণতা স্পষ্ট হয়েছে। সংগঠনটির [ঘোষিত উদ্দেশ্য](https://www.jamaat-e-islami.org/publication/file/185_constitution_Jan_2020.pdf) হচ্ছে ইসলামী সমাজব্যবস্থা প্রতিষ্ঠা করা। এই লক্ষ্য বাংলাদেশের সংবিধানপ্রদত্ত ধর্মনিরপেক্ষ ও গণতান্ত্রিক চরিত্রের সঙ্গে সাংঘর্ষিক। লক্ষ্য অর্জনের জন্য তারা ছাত্র সমাজকে প্রভাবিত করতে চায়। যার জন্য তারা স্কুল থেকেই তাদের কার্যক্রম শুরু করে এবং বিভিন্নভাবে প্রভাব খাটিয়ে কোমলমতি শিক্ষার্থীদের তাদের আদর্শে আনতে চেষ্টা করে, যা কিনা অনৈতিক কারণ এটা অনেকটা মগজধোলাই। এবং তারা এটা করে ধর্মের নামে, যেহেতু তারা ধর্মভিত্তিক পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি করে যা কিনা গণতন্ত্রের জন্য বিপজ্জনক। জামায়াতের আদর্শ মওদুদীবাদের বিপদ সম্পর্কেও [এখান](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBagqYrn9tg) থেকে আরো জেনে নিতে পারেন এবং কেন অনেক ইসলামী দল এবং আলেম এর বিরোধিতা করেন।\n\nধর্মভিত্তিক পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি শুধু সংখ্যালঘু নয়, বাকিদের জন্যও বিপজ্জনক। বিশ্বের বিভিন্ন দেশে দেখা গেছে, যখন ধর্ম বা জাতিগত পরিচয়ের ভিত্তিতে রাজনীতি জোরদার হয়, তখন সহিংসতা ও গৃহদ্বন্দ্ব বেড়ে যায়। যেমন ভারত এবং বিজেপি সরকার এর একটি বড় উদাহরণ। পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি সমাজকে একত্রিত না করে বরং খণ্ডিত করে। আর এখানে যখন ধর্মের বিভিন্ন ব্যাখ্যা আছে, তখন বিষয়টি আরো বিপজ্জনক হয়ে যায় যা কিনা অসহিষ্ণুতা বাড়িয়ে দেয়। যদি উদাহরণ দেই, ধরেন আপনি ধার্মিক এবং হিজাব করেন। আপনি নাও করতে পারেন এবং দুই ক্ষেত্রেই সেটা আপনার ব্যক্তিগত মত এবং অধিকার। তবে ধর্মভিত্তিক এসব দল ক্ষমতায় আসলে আপনার তাদের ব্যাখ্যা এবং মন মতই পর্দা করতে হবে। এই অসহিষ্ণুতা এবং জোর খাটানোর প্রবণতাই সব থেকে বিপজ্জনক।\n\nআর খেয়াল করে দেখবেন যে শিবির ধারাবাহিকভাবে মুনাফেকি রাজনীতি করে। তাদের গঠনতন্ত্রে নারী নেতৃত্ব নিষিদ্ধ, তাদের নারী কর্মীদেরও নেকাব করা বাধ্যতামূলক কিন্তু ডাকসুর প্রার্থী হিসেবে তারা এমন কিছু নারীকে দিয়েছে যাদের জন্য আবার এমনটি প্রযোজ্য নয়। এই দ্বিমুখী আচরণের যৌক্তিক ব্যাখ্যা কি? বিপরীতমুখী হয়ে গেল না? তারা যদি সত্যিই পরিবর্তন আর আধুনিক হত, তবে কি দ্বিমুখী আচরণ করতো? প্রকৃতপক্ষে এটা আসলে ধোঁকা ছাড়া আর কিছুই না। গুপ্ত এবং মুনাফেকি রাজনীতি করবে, সুবিধা নিবে কিন্তু কোন দায় নিবে না। যেমন কয়েকদিন আগে তাদের একজন কর্মী [গণধর্ষণের হুমকি](https://www.prothomalo.com/politics/29czmjum2o) দিল, কিন্তু আলোচনায় আসলে গুপ্ত রাজনীতির সুবিধা হিসেবে দল হিসেবে কোন দায়ই নিল না। আর অনলাইনে ধারাবাহিকভাবে নারী হেনস্তা এবং যে কোন সমালোচনার [হেনস্তা](https://www.facebook.com/abdul.qader.790007/posts/pfbid01JSoFFZeUBSiiRCDaCvKZGvvssu3X3C1GjvUHguefgSKwW5gEsHL7ZF9F6fFQ3Yal) তারা করেই যাচ্ছে ক্রমাগত।\n\nআর সবশেষে যে বিষয়ে বলবো তা হচ্ছে শিবির কি বাকি ছাত্র সংঘটনগুলোর থেকে আলাদা? এর উত্তর হচ্ছে হ্যাঁ এবং না দুটোই। শিবিরের আদর্শ এবং গঠনতন্ত্র অনেক আলাদা বাকি সংঘটনগুলোর থেকে। শিবির অনেক বেশি সংগঠিত এবং এরা প্রচুর মেধাবী শিক্ষার্থীও আকৃষ্ট করে। কিন্তু একটা কথা বুঝতে হবে যে মূর্খ শয়তানের থেকে শিক্ষিত শয়তান বেশি খারাপ। শিবিরের অনেক কর্মী এবং নেতা ব্যক্তি হিসেবে ভালো, দেশের ভালোও চায়, কিন্তু যখন দলগত এবং আদর্শগত এত সমস্যা থাকে, তখন সমষ্টিগতভাবে সাধারণত সেটা ভালো কিছু বয়ে আনে না। গত ১৬ বছর তারা লীগ দ্বারা অত্যাচারিত হয়েছে, তাই জেন জির অনেকেই হয়তো শিবিরের ইতিহাস সম্পর্কে জানে না। তখন এখনকার মত সোশ্যাল মিডিয়াও ছিল না তাই এই বিষয়ে তথ্য প্রমাণও কম। তার পরেও পুরনো পত্রিকা এবং সেই সময়কার আলোচকদের সাথে কথা বললে অনেক কিছুই জানবেন। এই বিষয়ে আর বেশি কিছু বলছি না তবে কারো আগ্রহ থাকলে তাসনীম খলিলের [এই](https://www.facebook.com/tasneem.khalil/posts/%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%97-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF-%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%93-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%93%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%A6%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%87-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9F%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%95/10170443322455319/) পোস্ট, এবং [এই](https://www.facebook.com/tasneem.khalil/posts/%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%97-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8-%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%AB%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%82-%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%95-%E0%A7%A7%E0%A7%AF%E0%A7%AD%E0%A7%A7-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B2%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%9B%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%98-%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%80-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9B%E0%A7%87-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%BE-%E0%A6%B9/10170448123495319/) পোস্ট দেখে নিতে পারেন। পোস্টের নিচেও অনেক মন্তব্য আর প্রমাণ আছে। শিবির যেসব ক্যাম্পাসের নিয়ন্ত্রণ পেয়েছিল (যেমন চবি), সেগুলোর সাংস্কৃতিক এবং সবকিছুর পরিবর্তনও একটু ঘাটলেই জানতে পারবেন। সেখানে তাদের নিয়ন্ত্রণ এবং সহিংসতা কেমন ছিল নিয়ন্ত্রণ নেওয়ার পরে একটু জেনে দেখবেন খোঁজ করে। এবং এটা মোটেও শুধু তাদের অতীত চরিত্র নয়, [বর্তমানেও](https://www.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/district/2ybmze1yxc) খুব বেশি পরিবর্তন হয় নাই। এরকম ভাবার কোন যৌক্তিক কারণ নেই যে অন্য দলগুলোর তুলনায় শিবির গেস্টরুম এবং সহিংসতার চর্চায় ভালো কোন নজির স্থাপন করবে।\n\nতাহলে আপনি ছাত্র শিবিরকে কখন এবং কেন ভোট দিবেন? সরলীকরণ করি একটু। নিম্নের যে কোন একটি সত্যি হলে ভোট দিন তাদের।\n\n* আপনি ১৯৭১ এবং মুক্তিযুদ্ধবিরোধী।\n* শহীদদের রক্তের সাথে বেঈমানি করতে আপনার খারাপ লাগে না। কারণ আপনি মনে করেন সেটা ৫০ বছর আগের কথা এবং শিবিরের এখন অনেক পরিবর্তন হয়েছে।\n* আপনি উগ্র ধর্মীয় মতবাদে বিশ্বাসী, অগণতান্ত্রিক পরিচয়ভিত্তিক রাজনীতি পছন্দ করেন, সংখ্যালঘু এবং নারীর অধিকার চান না।\n* আপনি তথাকথিত মূলধারার রাজনীতি নিয়ে চরম বিরক্ত। আপনি পরিবর্তন চান খুব করে। কিন্তু আপনার মাথায় বাস্তবতা নেই এবং এটা বুঝতে চান না যে পরিবর্তন শুধু ভালোর দিকে না, খারাপের দিকেও যেতে পারে। ঢিমেতালে আগালেও গণতান্ত্রিকভাবে দেশ এগিয়েছে এত দিন। আপনি মূলধারার রাজনৈতিক দলগুলোকে মধ্যাঙ্গুলি দেখানোর দিকে এতই মনোযোগী যে সেই বাস্তবতা অথবা ঝুঁকি বোঝার মত ক্ষমতা অথবা ইচ্ছা আপনার কোনটাই নেই। সহজ করে বললে আপনার মনটা ভালোই কিন্তু বোকার স্বর্গে বাস করেন।\n\nতো প্রিয় ছোট ভাই বোনেরা, জেন জি এবং তারুণ্যের নাম আর ডুবাবেন না। আপনারা পড়াশোনা জানা মানুষ, একটু ভাবেন। আর দিন শেষে ভাবনা চিন্তা করে যেটা ভালো মনে হয় করেন। যদি অযৌক্তিক কিছু বলে থাকি সেটা আলোচনা করেন। আর নাহলে এমন কাউকে নির্বাচিত করবেন না যার জন্য আপনার এবং জাতিকেও ভবিষ্যতে খেসারত দিতে হয়।\n\nব্যক্তিগত মত তুলে ধরেছি কিন্তু চেষ্টা করেছি নিরপেক্ষভাবে তথ্য প্রমাণ তুলে ধরেই বলার। ইচ্ছা হলে যে কোন অংশ কপি পেস্ট করে পোস্ট করতে পারেন, ক্রেডিট দেওয়ার দরকার নাই।\n\n",

        "body": "I’m a 21M, studying in a private university in Dhaka. I’ve always gone to all-boys schools/colleges, so I never really had the chance to interact much with girls. Growing up, I saw my friends with girlfriends, spending time together, talking for hours, having someone to lean on. Which is great, but what really hit me was... how far many of those if not all \"relationships\" went. Their girlfriends would send them nudes, do s\\*xchats over video calls, and in some cases even go as far as doing s\\*xual things in restaurants or some other place.\n\nI’ve never experienced anything like that, and now it worries me deeply. I keep asking myself: what if the woman I marry someday has a past like that too? Is this what I “deserve” for not being like the “normal” guys? AM I ALREADY FALLING BEHIND?\n\nAnother thing that confuses me: if a woman has done things like showing her body to multiple people, had casual encounters, or even let someone touch her just for something as small as a *400 takar lunch* at a restaurant, and then years later decides to “change”... does that make her the same as me? Does she still deserve my full love, respect and loyalty? People often say the past doesn’t define someone’s worth, but honestly, I struggle to accept that.\n\nAnd now I’m even more terrified because I can literally see myself being taken over by dark thoughts. I feel myself judging all my female classmates just because they’re female (It's been less that a month since I started attending university). In my mind, even if they had similar pasts, they’d never talk about it openly. They’d just think, “It was his fault, and I’m entitled to start fresh as if nothing happened.” This single thought makes me resent people for no real reason. Worse, I can’t even concentrate in my classes if the course instructor is a woman— because for all I know, she could be just like all the others.\n\nI know this isn’t healthy, and I don’t want to become bitter or hateful. I’d really appreciate if someone could help me get out of this mindset. I’d especially love to hear from people older than me, women, or anyone who has gone through something similar. And if you comment, please mention your age and gender. It would mean a lot.",

So any input on this matter would be greatly appreciated and if anybody can vouch for any such dalal, pls lmk",

Last night a lot of my family members were invited for the celebration of my parents' 25th anniversary, and due to me being an admission candidate, the talk about what I was preparing for came up. I said I am prepping for DU B and C and their face went pale as I said something so blasphemous that their comprehension cannot imagine. Their first question was. \"you read science your entire life and passed HSC with great grades; why are you going for commerce or arts? Why are you not prepping for buet?\" and in response I said that I want to stay at BD, and the current engineering market is very bad, and I don't want to study in a discipline that has so little potential here at bd. and their response was there is a huge market for engineering at BD, and then they proceeded to say the most hilarious thing i have heard in a while. They said, \"Desher CSE er to onek demand.\" I just wanted to laugh so hard. As I didn't want to argue with them, I said that \"mama, amar to eto brain nai CSE porar\" and left the living room and said to myself how unaware people are when they give any advice. When the potential of CS graduates getting a stable and good-paying job is at an all-time low in the entire world. when tech mammoths are laying off people, there are so many uncles that give this unsolicited advice. These people just cannot think for 2 minutes before spewing out uncalled advice, and the fact is they aren't illiterate or anything. They just feed into the echo chamber without realising what is happening around the world. These people make me so mad it's just insane",

After researching on YouTube, I found out that nowadays this type of fungal infection has become quite resistant and doesn’t go away easily. I’m really frustrated with this — it itches a lot throughout the day, and even more at night.\n\nIf any of you have received treatment from a dermatologist and fully recovered, please let me know. Also, kindly mention their consultation fee and the location where they practice.",

Is there any similar service for receiving Euros?\n\nI’ve also looked into Payoneer for a Euro account, but their transaction fees are pretty high, and their service is bad.\n\nI know I could convert Euros to USD inside Deel, but the conversion fee is quite high, and I’d like to avoid losing that much.\n\nThe same goes for direct bank transfers to local Bangladeshi accounts. Too much hassle and government fees.\n\nAny workarounds or advice would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

        "body": "There are over 9,000 public libraries and more than 125,000 librarians across the United States, all of which offer a wide variety of resources and services to the communities they serve. Similarly, Australia has a fantastic network of public libraries across all its states. Users can access an extensive catalogue of print, electronic, and multimedia resources as well as free Wi-Fi, computers, printing services, study spaces, groups, classes, and much more by joining a single library. \n\nAccording to the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, neighboring India also has an impressive library network, with approximately 1.5 million libraries, including 1.3 million school libraries—the highest single number of libraries globally. The country also hosts over 160,000 public and community libraries, with one public library for every 8,333 people, which is more than double the Asian and global averages. In Sri Lanka, according to the National Library and Document Services Board (NLDSB), there are approximately 1,500 public libraries—one for every 14,595 people. The respective local governments and urban and municipal councils govern all public libraries.\n\nCompared to India and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh has only 71 public libraries, a disproportionately low number considering the population—resulting in there being one public library for every 2,402,143 people. How embarrassing is that? \n\nI gathered the above information from The Daily Star. For all the talk and complaining we do about \"lack of civic sense\" and political and social justice, we don't pay attention to the very real cause of it all, low access to education especially in rural regions and the distinct lack of libraries in this country. Instead of protesting for delaying or cancelling exam results or forming new colleges or other ludicrous purposes we should protest to increase the availability of books across the country, not just the Capital. This will undoubtedly encourage young under-privileged men and women who want to be educated but don't have the money to enroll in a school. And, as a result will instill civic sense, duty and national responsibility in them.",

Meanwhile, look at other countries and their men. Arab and bengali guys look so similar but are so far off each other lookswise because bengali men dont look after themselves properly. Honestly, your looks show ur discipline. Im not telling u to look like a 10/10 but atleast clean up properly. This is why u guys complain 24/7 about being single.\n\nSecondly, a vast majority of u smoke and drink which causes u to be even uglier and look older. If a woman did the same, you wouldnt even look at her. A lot of u dont even pray 5 times a day and then claim to want pious wives. Honestly ask yourselves if u would want a wife who is like u exactly😂🤣.\n\nTo you girls, theres good men out there actually so dont settle for these chapris. We should start settling for better looking men not the old wrinkly ones who smoke and stink. Truth is a man wouldnt look at u if u were also their level of ugly.  Its our fault for settling for losers. Now theyre comfortable with being one. And honestly if u dont mind the perfect match in this life, thats ok. We only have like 40-60 years on this earth \n\n\nAnd honestly, whatever i listed is still bare minimum.\n\nI cant wait to see the same men complain in the comments. If the shoe fits, cinderella😂. Just aim to be better in life rather than barking like a dog in these comments\n\n\n\nEDIT: Im giving up on convincing u losers in the comments to be a better person for ur sake. Your body is a direct reflection of ur mental state. IF u cant take care of it, ofc you will complain about others having higher standards. Love urself and treat ur body better ",

In many views, it is the weakest administration in Bangladesh’s history: so weak that even the United States would not pursue reciprocal tariff arrangements with it!!\n\nIts leaders often appear timid, unable to control the streets during a period that saw over 1,700 protests in 500 days!! They seem novice and ineffective, struggling even to pass laws, let alone enforce them!! The Interim Government has repeatedly buckled under pressure from relatively small or little-known groups!!\n\nOver the past 15 months, the IG has been bombarded with accusations of inertia and incompetence. Many dismiss it as a “do-nothing, makhon-khawa group” that stumbled into power by luck and achieved nothing and now was looking for an ignominous safe exit!!!\n\nAnd yet, when I look back, I say with confidence that this has been one of the most consequential governments of Bangladesh in many decades. It has achieved almost everything it set out to do.\n\n#Peace and stability restored. Post revolution revenge attacks brought to a halt.\n\n#The US tariff deal was secured without hiring a single lobbying firm.\n\n#A record number of laws were enacted in just 15 months, including sweeping new labour reforms.\n\n#The July Declaration established a historic new platform, and the July Charter created a political settlement that may reshape national politics for generations.\n\n#The Supreme Court asserted control over the lower judiciary, making it far more difficult for future governments to weaponize bail decisions or pursue politically motivated cases.\n\n#One of the world’s leading port operators signed the Laldia Terminal agreement, laying the foundation for a manufacturing transformation. It is the single largest European investment.\n\n#A new foreign policy framework has positioned Bangladesh at the centre of the Indo-Pacific.\n\n#The economy has been stabilised and returned to a growth trajectory.\n\n#Banking-sector plunder was curbed, the taka stabilised, and inflation contained—food inflation falling from 14 percent to seven.\n\n#According to court proceedings, accountability began to emerge for past abuses, and a long-awaited sense of justice has begun to take shape. Sheikh Hasina has been shown her place!!\n\n#Forced disappearances ceased, the BAL extremist political culture that once dominated our national life has been neutralised, and a cultural revival has followed—bolstered by widely viewed documentaries detailing earlier abuses. It is a Farooki- effect!!\n\n#The RAB now operates under the law rather than informal doctrines, and intelligence agencies have retreated from harassing dissidents. \n\n#Freedom of press and freedom of speech have been restored. Not a single staged “crossfire” incident has been reported in the last 16 months.\n\nI could go on. As an avid reader of our history, I believe no government in Bangladesh has achieved as much in such a short period as the IG has over these fifteen and a half months.\n\nFull stop.\n\n#DhakaDiary",

CU is situated in the second most important city in Bangladesh. Many countries of the world have the best universities either in the capital or in the port city. CU has not been able to live up to its potential.\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts.",

        "body": "Need advice\n\nSo i basically worked at this Photoshop/photomela which I joined at first thinking I'll get to learn Microsoft office and other stuff which i did the first couple weeks from the other workers but.. after that i stopped learning stuff, i was there from 9am till isha prayer almost everyday, besides friday or if some mezban/urush/ biye etc type stuff was happening for almost 3 months, it became a job basically, i got paid like 50tk a day for my bus fare. The workers were nice tho ngl about that, even the owner was friendly but when it came to the money side and how long Iam \"working\" there they get pretty strict, obviously I don't like it anymore, i mean fair i learned quite a bit talking with different kind of customers and learning how to use adobe Photoshop and word etc. but.. is it really worth all that? Opening the shop at 9am and cleaning it up myself like... I don't know if im the one who's getting alot and still complaining or other way around, i only feel bad because the staff there were genuinely good people I liked hanging out with.... But that wasn't my goal at the start.. I joined in to learn.. which i stopped doing after awhile. Also another thing is.. Im one of those bekar unemployed, not studying anymore guys, that was the reason i joined this place like 3 months ago... I don't know what to do with my life, clearly this isn't it since im just wasting time here, but I don't know what else I can do...\n\nEdit: thought I should share a bit about myself. Iam 19 years old, I used to live in Oman and came back to Bangladesh at 2022 because i had visa problems, I missed my highschool exams i was basically part of the 2022 batch of SSC examinees.. which i missed and i didn't study since, been 3 years, dad went to UAE 2 Years ago and I thought he'd take me soon.. its been quite awhile im still here.. it's kinda funny but anyways.. I don't know how much longer im gonna be here but I don't want to waste it, someone bestow some wisdom on me, im really broke so IELTS is not on the table right now, im saying this because i got suggested this one multiple times. Im really broke right now, not just me, my whole family, hence why Im still here in bd instead of going to UAE because I can't buy the damn visa and some other stuff. Anyplace i can learn some work.. whatever kind of work that would benefit me later on where I might be able to make some money aswell... Again please don't say IELTS or school.. give me some proper advice older brothers and sisters of this subreddit 🙏",

My parents are open to helping, but they are also unsure how the process works now since society has changed a lot.\n\nRecently I’ve seen many online discussions about modern dating, trust issues, expectations, betrayal, etc., which honestly made me a bit confused about what the normal marriage process looks like for Bangladeshis today especially for someone living abroad.\n\nFor those who went through arranged or semi-arranged marriage recently:\n\t•\tHow did the process go?\n\t•\tWhat should someone like me realistically expect? How do I do the genuine background check.\n\t•\tAny advice for someone who wants a stable, respectful, religiously aligned partner?\n\nI’m Muslim and try my best to practice, and I’m hoping to find someone who shares similar values.

But she couldn't pursue her career to take care of my older brother, who has autism.\n\nI finished my admission exam in 25. I actually got a seat at DU B unit, but as it was a low-ranking subject, I decided not to pursue it after studying for a couple of months. I chose to enroll in a Private University to get a good subject.\n\nIg my mom didn't like that. Now, like in every argument, she tells me \"Kono public e chance peye dekhate paros nai\", \"At least amra nijer ma baba ke khushi korte parsi DU te pore\", and if I correct her sentences or oppose her arguments in any other topic, she just replies with \"Tui toh DU teo tike thakte parli na\" and shii.\n\nIk that DU is tuff for this country, but Idk, now I don't even wanna study anything anymore. Her arguments are seriously getting under my skin. Today we argued and she said \"Tor toh kono bhalo bondhu o nai, amar bondhu ra at least DU te porse, tui toh gazadi der sathe ghure beras\" like tf???? She doesn't even say sorry, and if I argue too much, she decides to spit in my face and call me \"Kulangar\" and a \"Devil's spawn\".\n\nA couple of days back, I actually went to the private university I wanted to get admission in, just to check out the campus and to know a few details about the subject and the cost. My mom insisted that she come with me. I bought her along with me. I talked to the Apu at the office and got the details. BUT, when we were about to leave, my mom just stood up and told the Apu that \"Janen amar chele er ageh DU te chilo, and amio DU r student\". The girl sitting behind us just looked at me like \"Really, is this fr??\" I felt so embarrassed, I just walked out. So is anyone's mom like tis or am I just losing my mind over nothing?\n\nWhat type of Institutional pride is this?",

People try to include me and they’re actually really kind but even then I feel like I add nothing. I don’t have that spark or talent or anything interesting to bring with me. It’s like I’m just a face pretty maybe but nothing deeper that stands out. I’m slow at understanding people, slower than others at getting jokes or joining conversations. And half the time, I don’t even know what to talk about. It’s not about being introverted either I’ve seen quiet people with this soft charm that makes them easy to love. I just don’t feel like I have that. I feel invisible even when I’m right there.\n",

I’m not here to argue I’m just genuinely interested.\n\nIf you believe in jinn (or even if you don’t but have a weird story), I’d love to hear it. What happened? Where were you? Did it only happen once or more than once? How did you feel during and after the experience?\n\nFamily stories, personal encounters, things your grandparents told you, sleep paralysis, shadow figures, whispers, dreams literally anything. I just want a good spooky read.\n\nPlease share your stories if you’re comfortable. I’ll read every single one.\n",

He’s also applying to BUTEX, but he’s a bit confused about choosing the right department.\n\nBUTEX has around 11 different departments under Textile Engineering, and since he’s not very familiar with the textile field, he isn’t sure which ones offer better career opportunities, industry demand, research potential, and overall student experience.\n\nIf anyone here is a current BUTEX student, graduate, or has experience in the textile industry, your suggestions would be really helpful. Which departments are the most promising right now? And what should he keep in mind while selecting his preferences?\n\n\nThanks in advance for any helpful advice!",

The laptop was originally bought in 2021 and worked fine until I replaced the display in early 2024 due to scratch marks. After about a year, the new display started glitching, showing a horizontal white line and occasionally going completely black. Over time, the screen stopped displaying anything except a faint backlight. I tried updating drivers, reinstalling the OS, and even detaching the HDD, and the laptop worked briefly before a charger accidentally fell on the keyboard from about 40 cm. Since then, the display has been blank again, although the system still powers on. Multiple technicians couldn’t identify the issue, with guesses ranging from GPU to cooling problems. Battery health is also poor. Now, the laptop only shows a dim backlight with no image. I need help figuring out the real cause and whether it’s something repairable possibly a cable issue, display failure, or something else. Any guidance would be appreciated.  \n  \nPlease refer some trusted laptop repair shops in Dhaka \n\nThanks for your time",

Not because I dislike people or friendships, but because my heart moves slowly. I connect deeply, not quickly. I have a small circle, and it takes me a lifetime to truly let someone in.\n\nThe last few years have been messy for me. And a few months ago, I pushed myself to step out of that shell I had lived in for so long. I tried to explore life more, talk to people more, socialize more, and allow myself to feel a little lighter.\nBut now I feel exhausted in a way that is hard to explain.\nOverwhelmed. Drained. Lost.\nLike I took ten steps forward just to end up standing in the same old place again.\n\nI don’t want to distance myself from the few people I genuinely care about, because I don’t want misunderstandings or to seem uninterested. But at the same time, I feel like I can’t handle too much anymore. My mind needs silence but my heart doesn’t want to hurt anyone. And this conflict is eating me up.\n\nI don’t think everyone would understand this sudden wave of emptiness I’m feeling — how it comes without warning, how it makes my efforts feel wasted, how it reminds me that healing is not a straight line. It’s confusing, and honestly, painful.\n\nStill, I won’t give up. I know life requires adjusting, and maybe this is just another phase I need to breathe through.\nI just wanted to share this here, without being judged or misunderstood, because writing feels like my only escape sometimes.\n\nIf any of you feel the same way, you’re not alone. You can share your thoughts too or tell me what helps you survive these phases.\nAnd whatever you’re going through, please be kind to yourself and to others.

When the result came today, my mom started talking to me angrily, saying, “Why didn’t your result change?” She said she can’t face relatives because I didn’t get an A+, and that I should feel ashamed for not getting it. On result day, all the relatives kept calling again and again — it was so annoying. I don’t even understand why they care so much about my result. My mom even said that if I don’t get admission anywhere, I won’t even have the right to show my face to anyone. You tell me is an A+ really that valuable in Bangladesh? Do you need an A+ just to look “worthy” in front of others? Today I’m really heartbroken. Yes, my result isn’t great and I already feel bad about it, but on top of that, my own family is making me feel even smaller.",

        "body": "Translated my previous post. \n\nসবার প্রতি সালাম, আমি জেমস—অবশ্যই আমার আসল নাম নয়, পরিচয় গোপন রাখার জন্য।\n\nঘটনাটি শেয়ার করার আগে কিছু প্রেক্ষাপট দিচ্ছি। আমি কয়েক বছর আগে অস্ট্রেলিয়ায় আসি। প্রথমে অন্য একটি বড় শহরে পড়াশোনা করি, তারপর ভালো সুযোগের জন্য কুইন্সল্যান্ডে চলে আসি। আল্লাহর রহমতে বিভিন্ন জব করেছি এবং ২০২২ সাল থেকে স্বাস্থ্যখাতে পড়াশোনা ও কাজ করছি—এখনও করছি।\n\nবাংলাদেশ থেকে যারা আসেন তারা জানেন, স্বাস্থ্যখাতে বাংলাদেশি দেখা কতটাই বিরল। আমার ক্লাসে বা কর্মস্থলে কখনও কোনও বাংলাদেশি পাইনি। গত ৩.৫ বছরে কুইন্সল্যান্ডে আমি মূলত ফিলিপিনো, ইন্ডিয়ান, নেপালি ও অন্যান্য জাতিগোষ্ঠীর সঙ্গে কাজ করেছি। তাদের কমিউনিটি যতটা ঐক্যবদ্ধ দেখে, সেটা আমাকে অনুপ্রাণিত করেছিল বাংলাদেশি কমিউনিটির সঙ্গে যুক্ত হতে। আমার অবশ্যই লোকাল বন্ধু আছে, কিন্তু একে তো সংস্কৃতির একটা টান থাকে, আর আমি কখনও আমার সংস্কৃতি থেকে দূরে থাকতে চাইনি। আমি সত্যিই চেয়েছিলাম এমন কিছু মানুষ পেতে যাদের সঙ্গে ভাষা, সংস্কৃতি, ব্যাকগ্রাউন্ড মিলে।\n\nএকটি গ্রুপ ছিল, যেটি কুইন্সল্যান্ডের একটি বাংলাদেশি স্টুডেন্ট অ্যাসোসিয়েশনের সাথে যুক্ত। কেউ আমাকে সেখানে অ্যাড করেছিলেন। জুলাই ২০২৪ এর প্রোটেস্টের পর গ্রুপটি বেশ সক্রিয় হয়ে উঠেছিল—মানুষ পরস্পরকে সাহায্য করছিল, কানেক্ট হচ্ছিল। কিন্তু আমি যোগ দেওয়ার কয়েক মিনিট পরেই হঠাৎ আমাকে গ্রুপ এবং চ্যাট—দুটো থেকেই ব্যান করে দেওয়া হল।\n\nগ্রুপটির অ্যাডমিন—ধরি তার নাম এন—সে আমার এক কাজিনের বন্ধু। কয়েক বছর আগে আমাদের মধ্যে ব্যক্তিগত একটি ঝামেলা হয়েছিল, যা কমিউনিটির সঙ্গে কোনও সম্পর্ক ছিল না। সে সেই পুরনো বিষয়টি ভুলতে পারেনি এবং অ্যাডমিন ক্ষমতা ব্যবহার করে ব্যক্তিগত বিরোধের কারণে আমাকে ব্যান করে দিল।\n\nশুরুতে তেমন পাত্তা দিইনি। কিন্তু কিছুদিন আগে যখন আমি রেন্টাল ভ্যাকান্সির পোস্ট দিচ্ছিলাম, তখন ঘটনা বদলে যায়। ভাগ্যক্রমে আমি এমন জায়গায় থাকি যেখানে মালিক আমাকে ঘর সাবলেট করতে বিশ্বাস করেন। এভাবে কিছু বাংলাদেশি রুম খুঁজতে এসে আমার সঙ্গে যোগাযোগ করল, এবং শেষে তিনজন বাংলাদেশি আমার বাসায় উঠল।\n\nপ্রতিদিন তাদের সাথে আমার নিজের ভাষায় কথা বলতে বলতে বুঝতে পারলাম—এতদিন আমি এই কানেকশনটা কতটা মিস করছিলাম। ৩–৪ বছর শুধু ইংরেজিতে কথা বলে এবং স্বাস্থ্যখাতে বাংলাদেশি না পেয়ে, মাতৃভাষায় স্বাভাবিক কথোপকথনই যেন মন শান্ত করে দিয়েছিল।\n\nতাদের একজনের সাথে আমি তাহসানের কনসার্টেও গিয়েছিলাম। সেখানে এক সিনিয়র ভাইয়ের সঙ্গে—ধরি তার নাম এস—দেখা হল। উনি খুব ভালোভাবে অভিবাদন জানালেন, আমি পুরো ঘটনা বললাম। উনি বললেন দেখবেন। কিছুই হয়নি, এবং সত্যি বলতে তাকে দোষ দিই না। তার পরিবার-দায়িত্ব আছে; বেশিরভাগ মানুষ এমন ক্ষুদ্র ঝামেলায় জড়াতে চান না। তাই এটাও ছেড়ে দিলাম।\n\nকিছুদিন পর কেউ একজন এন-এর বিরুদ্ধে অভিযোগ পোস্ট করল—একজনকে হুমকি দেওয়া এবং রাজনৈতিক সংযোগের ইঙ্গিত নিয়ে। তখন আরেকজন সম্মানিত কমিউনিটি লিডার—ধরি তার নাম এ—পাবলিকলি লিখলেন যে বুলিং, হয়রানি বা বৈষম্য কাউকেই ছাড় দেওয়া হবে না।\n\nআমি তাকে ব্যক্তিগতভাবে জিজ্ঞেস করলাম,\n“যদি যিনি এগুলো করছেন তিনি কমিউনিটি লিডার হন, তাহলে?”\nতিনি বললেন, ভুল তো ভুলই।\n\nতখন আমি তাকে পুরো ঘটনা খুলে বললাম—কীভাবে আমি শুধু নিজের কমিউনিটির সাথে সংযোগ করতে চেয়েছিলাম, সাহায্য করতে ও নিজেও কানেক্টেড থাকতে চেয়েছিলাম।\nভাই এ এন-এর সাথে যোগাযোগ করেন। কাজিনকেও বললাম বিষয়টি। আমি একটাই কথা স্পষ্ট করলাম—পুরনো ব্যক্তিগত ঝগড়াকে অজুহাত বানিয়ে কাউকে কমিউনিটি থেকে বাদ দেওয়া অন্যায়। অ্যাডমিন হওয়া মানে কারও উপর ব্যক্তিগত ক্ষমতা খাটানোর লাইসেন্স নয়।\n\nকাজিন এবং ভাই এ দু’জনই এন-এর সাথে কথা বলার চেষ্টা করেন, কিন্তু সে বিষয়টি এড়িয়ে যায়। শেষে সে শুধু জানায়—সে আমাকে গ্রুপে নেবে না। কোনও যুক্তি নেই, কোনও ব্যাখ্যা নেই—শুধু জেদ।\n\nঅনেকে সহজেই বুঝতে পারবেন আমি কার কথা বলছি, কারণ এর আগেও তাকে বাংলাদেশের একটি রাজনৈতিক দলের সাথে জড়িত বলে অভিযোগ উঠেছিল। মজার বিষয়, সে নিজেই বলেছিল সে দলের নয়, কারণ সে নাকি তাদের বিরুদ্ধে “প্রোটেস্ট করেছিল”—কিন্তু তার আচরণ ঠিক সেই গত দশকের দেশের রাজনৈতিক চরিত্রগুলোর মতো।\n\nসে এমনকি আমার কাজিনকে বলেছে কিছু নির্দিষ্ট আত্মীয়কে নাকি অভিযোগ করবে এবং “অ্যাকশন নেবে”—মানে পরিস্থিতি বাড়াতে চাইছিল, অথচ আমার উদ্দেশ্য ছিল শুধু ন্যায্যতা। আমি কাজিনকে বললাম—মানুষ জানুক বা না জানুক, আমার আপত্তি নেই; আমি শুধু চাই অন্যরা জানুক কীভাবে কিছু লোক ভদ্রতার মুখোশ পরে ব্যক্তিগত শত্রুতার বদলা নেয়।\n\nদীর্ঘদিন ধরেই তার আচরণ নিয়ে বিভিন্ন মানুষের কাছ থেকে গুজব ও অভিযোগ শুনেছি—যেগুলো আমি বলব না, কারণ তার মতো পেছনে লাগা বা অপবাদ দেওয়া আমার উদ্দেশ্য নয়।\n\nযা আমাকে সবচেয়ে বিস্মিত করেছে—সে আমাকে ব্যান করলেও, স্বাস্থ্যখাত সম্পর্কিত কোনও তথ্য জানতে কেউ তাকে জিজ্ঞেস করলে সে আমার নম্বর তাদের কাছে দিয়ে দিত।\nকারণ “এন ভাইয়া আপনার নম্বর দিছে”—এই কথাই শোনা যেত।\nমানে, তার নিজের প্রয়োজনে আমি ভালো, কিন্তু কমিউনিটিতে আমার থাকা সে মেনে নিতে পারে না।\n\nআমি প্রচুর জাতিগোষ্ঠীর মানুষের সাথে কাজ করেছি—অস্ট্রেলিয়ান, পাঞ্জাবি, ফিলিপিনো, নেপালি, সাউথ ইন্ডিয়ান—কিন্তু এমন নোংরা গেটকিপিং আর কোথাও দেখিনি। যাদের কাছে গিয়েছিলাম তারা চেষ্টা করেছেন—সেটা আমি সম্মান করি—কিন্তু বেশি কিছু করার ছিল না।\n\nতাই হ্যাঁ—এমন সাপে ভরা মানুষের ব্যাপারে সতর্ক থাকুন। তারা বাইরে থেকে হাসিমুখে সাহায্যকারী সাজে, ছোট্ট কোনও উপকার করলে দশজনকে বলে বেড়ায়, অথচ আড়ালে ক্ষমতার অপব্যবহার করে। যে সত্যিকারের সাহায্য করে, সে চুপচাপ করে; সে ক্ষমতা দেখিয়ে মানুষকে অপমান করে না।\n\nআমার ব্যক্তিগত ভাবে তেমন কষ্ট নেই। আমার কাজ ও পড়াশোনা ভালোই চলছে, আল্লাহর রহমতে সব ঠিক আছে। দুঃখ শুধু এই—বিদেশের মাটিতে নিজের কমিউনিটির সাথে কানেক্ট হতে চেয়ে, সংস্কৃতির টান বজায় রাখতে চেয়ে, কেউ একজনের ছোট মনের কারণে এমনভাবে দূরে সরিয়ে দেওয়া হয়।\n\nসত্যিকারের সদাচরণ নীরব।\nসত্যিকারের নেতৃত্ব ব্যক্তিগত আবেগ নয়, কমিউনিটির স্বার্থ দেখে।\n\nএমন ভণ্ড, ছদ্মবেশী মানুষ থেকে সাবধান থাকুন। নিজের পরিচিতজনদেরও সচেতন করুন।\n\nআর যদি আপনারা জানেন কীভাবে এমন মানুষদের ব্যাপারে আরও বেশি মানুষকে সচেতন করা যায়, তাহলে আমাকে জানান।”",

I don’t even have travel *dreams* yet! I got NID and student ID — that’s the whole package!”\n\nSo now I’m here asking the people of Reddit before I embarrass myself again:\n\n* **Where can I get my first few foreign notes in Dhaka without all the hassle?**\n* **Anybody know legit collectors, shops, or online spots where they don’t try to hustle you?**\n* **Should I start with the cheap old-school notes first?**\n* **And yo, what scams should I watch out for? ’Cause I ain’t tryna get played like that.**\n\nIf you got advice, drop it here.

Later the next day was off day and I was suppose to join from today (15th of Nov). So i was told to be present there at 10 am. After that, the receptionist told me to wait for the HR and I waited for like 2 goddamn hours. Then they told me to go the cabin where HR and the manager were present. They let me sit and told me that we aren’t continuing with you because of the post you made (are you fucking kidding me!?) I simply said that it was my right to know about your company since your digital presence isn’t visible enough. Then she dared to threat me saying that, 'eshob khetre amra police case kore thaki, apni fresher dekhe kichu korini' duh. Tarpor the manager started giving me lecture but i left the room right away.

        "body": "Hi everyone,  \nI built an Android app '**Find My Train: Bangladesh**', to help people track Bangladesh Railway trains in real time. The app shows the live position of running trains so you can locate your train easily. My goal is to make train tracking simple and helpful for everyone.\n\nYou can try the testing version by following these steps:\n\n**Step 1:** Join the tester Google Group [(link here)](https://groups.google.com/g/mytraintrackerbd) \\[ [https://groups.google.com/g/mytraintrackerbd](https://groups.google.com/g/mytraintrackerbd) \\]\n\n**Step 2:** Install the app from the Play Store [(Playstore)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app) \\[ [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mytraintrackerbd.app) \\]\n\nNote: Without step 1, step 2 won't work. If the app does not appear, please make sure you are using the same Google account for both steps.\n\nAfter trying it, if you notice any issue in loading, tracking, or timing, please share your feedback in the comments.\n\nHope this makes Bangladesh Railway travel way less stressful for everyone!",

        "body": "Hi everyone,  \nYesterday, my phone (Google Pixel 7 Pro) was stolen from my pocket while I was getting into the train at Airport Railway Station. I filed a GD at Airport Railway Station Thana, but I’m not sure what else I can do now to try to recover it.\n\nMy biggest concern is unauthorized access to my personal data. I’ve already taken the following steps today:\n\n* Reissued my SIM\n* Signed out of all Google accounts\n* Logged out of apps like WhatsApp and other services\n* Locked the device from my Google account\n\nStill, I’m worried if there’s anything more I should do to protect my data or increase the chance of getting the phone back.\n\nIf anyone has experience with similar cases or knows the proper steps to take in Dhaka, I would really appreciate your guidance.  \nSpecifically:\n\n* Any realistic ways to track or recover a stolen phone here?\n* Whether contacting the mobile operator or Google support helps in any way\n* How to effectively follow up with the thana to improve recovery chances\n* Any additional precautions to secure my data\n\nAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\n  \nI also used GPT to refine this post so that I can clearly explain my situation.\\*",

        "body": "After the earthquakes that hit Bangladesh in the last 2 days News outlets have started over exaggerating the threat. They are capitalizing on people's fear. I saw one outlet literally saying there can be magnitude 9 earthquakes in Bangladesh. First of all this is total vogus. Bangladesh does not have the type of subduction zone needed for magnitude 9 earthquakes. So it is highly unlikely to be hit by a mag 9 earthquake. Now about today's earthquake. After any 5-6 magnitude earthquake aftershocks are normal. 2-10 aftershocks in the first 24–72 hours is common. Now it's not that there isn't any risk of earthquake anymore. There's still a chance to be hit by a big earthquake. Research says there can be maximum 7.5-8 mag earthquake in this zone. So now it's not the time to get scared. We need to be prepared for earthquake. We need to make preparation. Mark places you can take shelter during earthquakes(hard tables,beds), keep a bag ready with important papers, keep your shoes/sandles out because there can be debris in worst case scenarios, keep a bag ready with dry food and water and Always keep faith in your god and let's pray for each other's safety.

My goal is to finish the entire exam process (all subjects) and pass the board exam within approximately 12 months.\nMy Background &amp; Constraints:\nGoal: Complete HSC in 1 year.\nPreferred Group: Science is ideal, but I am prepared to switch to Humanities or Commerce if that group offers a more realistic path for a 1-year completion.\nEducation Gap: I have a significant 4-year break since passing Class 10 (SSC/equivalent). 2024-2025 batch from a vocational school.\nWork Schedule: This is the biggest challenge. I work a fixed night shift from 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM. I am only available for classes/studying during the daytime/morning.\nGroup Recommendation: Based on my time constraint, would Commerce or Humanities be a more manageable syllabus to complete in 1 year compared to Science?\n\nAlso I need some career advice as well I wanted to be a software engineer or at least a computer science background, it's my passion. But I don't think I can do it with commerce or humanities\nBut anyways thanks",

I always reach on time and receive the shift properly, even on days when I don’t even get a chance to eat. But many of my colleagues come late with excuses, and since we have no digital attendance system, entry/exit time isn’t properly monitored. Because of that, I often end up doing extra time after my shift is already over. It’s exhausting, and I don’t know if I should “accept it as normal” or speak up — but it’s bothering me a lot.\n\nI hired someone to cook for me so I can manage my time better, but most of the time she doesn’t prepare food on time. So I often go to work without eating.\n\nMy family situation adds more weight. My father is always in debt somehow. My mother sold her own land multiple times to clear it. A few years ago I also took a bank loan to pay off his debt — but again he’s in debt. I almost carry all of my parents’ expenses, but still I don’t get the support, understanding, or stability I need from them.\n\nOn top of everything, I’m not a social person. I struggle to connect with people, so I often feel lonely and frustrated. And the environment around me doesn’t help much either.\n\nI don’t know if others feel this way, but my life constantly feels messed up. I’m trying, but some days it just becomes too much.",

Now since I can't control myself when I get annoyed I tend to raise my voice a lot or shout at them. And I behave very rudely when they barge in when I'm studying. My focus tends to get ruined at the smallest of sounds so it's so so hard for me to get my focus back when they barge in and talk to me and thus I get angry and my first tendency is to shout. I can't help it since I struggle a lot to get my focus back once it's Lost. Now the thing is I think is might be one of the major reasons Allah isn't accepting my duas. I want to control this reaction of mine no matter how much struggle or anger it brings. Any suggestions how to stop this response? They disturb me frequently specially my father like barges in my room 6-7 times an hour when he's at home. And no telling him no doesn't work. Ofc it doesn't. Give me suggestions ",

        "body": "Ok, feel like I should give some context as to explain my situation first.\nI graduated from Marketing dept at a public uni back in 2017. CGPA was 3.07 on a 4.0 scale.\nAfter a while, I joined as a Marketing Researcher (part time) at a startup. \nAfter 6 months, I joined as a full time digital marketing co-ordinator, where the roles included: digital media content planning, writing, designing, social media &amp; website handling etc. Worked for a year or so, then the company shut down. \nIt was around 2021 &amp; I was unemployed again. Never really finding a good match &amp; frustrated with Covid &amp; private sector situation, I then started prepping for gov jobs. \nLong story short, there’s been around 3-4 years of gap here &amp; there, then I had to switch my path.\nI’ve been working as an assistant school teacher at a gov primary school for 3 years now.\nRecently attended IELTS, score came out 8.0.\n\nI’m 30F, unmarried. I know I’m late but I still want to settle down somewhere safer for a single woman. My budget is mid, so I’ll probably need some scholarships/waivers.\nI would like to go to Canada/Australia/USA. But, I’m afraid I’d probably be rejected amidst all the crazy rigid rules. Or even if I do make it somehow, maybe I will be kicked out without a PR. \nAccording to you, which country seems like the best option right now?\nAnd I’m also really, really confused about what course &amp; career path should I go for; after going through such a chaotic track. I don’t really hate teaching as a profession, but it seems criminally under-appreciated (besides being majorly brain-rotting). I’m thinking how it’d be to do M.Ed abroad and become a teacher there (definitely not as easy as here.) \nKinda scared about reuniting with Marketing/Business though, with the rapid growth in big data, AI, AGI &amp; such. I remember I enjoyed studying subjects like Economics, Statistics, IMC and Consumer Behaviour. What’re some  viable course options relevant to any of these that can give you sustainable leverage (demand wise) in the job market &amp; maybe help getting PR too? Help a sis out please, TYSM.",

Only that it comes w endless access. I dont only want to imagine myself having my dream life while being a mess in real life. I might be visiting dhaka soon.

So, I can not but enjoy other psychological findings as well, now the question is :   \n  \n**Why the majority of girls who are children of big-shot government employees can not tolerate if anyone indicates to the mass wealth they have in the family and gets triggered?**   \n**But they do know the land cruiser they are using can never be bought with their papa's honest money and try to defend it, while boys just accept it and laughs it off?**\n\nI want to know what actually goes into the mind of girls during that time, I didn't find much on google on real Bangladeshi girls' statement\n\nThanks!",

But damn being a woman in her late 20s in a country like bangladesh feels like a curse. We are viewed as undesirable. You feel this immense pressure from your family, society to sort things out asap and get married and have bunch of kids. Because that's the only goal in a woman's life.\n\nEven if you do all of that I have seen that they are still depressed and sad most of the time. Aside from family and societal expectations, there is your own personal issues. Most of you probably haven't achieved everything you wanted to. I mean growing up you have a picture in your mind how your adult life is going to be. And when you are that adult and your life doesn't turn out how you wanted you feel like you let down your younger self. I am now older, and even more depressed. It feels like my future is dark. That my life is not going anywhere. And I will be stuck in a broken marriage where I will be forced to have children.\n\nI am sure we have our fears but why does your late 20s feel like this? I mean shouldn't we have figured out life by now? Achieved all our goals and settle. Instead I can't settle because to me settling looks like accepting defeat. That I lost to achieve my goals. And why do I always feel tired and drained. I mean even when I was in university I had to walk for 30 minutes to get to my classes and then travel 2 hours home I would still have energy to do things. Now, even weekends feel like draining. Why does it feel like everything is falling apart? Like where is the logic?",

I don’t want to isolate myself completely, but I also don’t want to get dragged into drama, competition, or fake friendships.\n\nFor those who have been through similar university environments:\nHow did you protect your peace and maintain your mental health?\nHow do you deal with ‘double-faced’ or toxic people while still surviving socially on campus?",

        "body": "I know some people will be against it but I'm still saying it anyway. My few neighbour aunts are involved in Jamaat-e-islami and hearing some of their opinions made me question about everything. Islam gave all kinds of halal rights to women but they'll be doing them covering themselves, we all know that. But what do you mean by Allah SWT said that marry only those women who can give birth. Does that mean women who are infertile will be neglected? They can't even give proper reference to this. Also women are allowed to jobs in Islam even Bibi Khadiza also did business at that time. But they'll be saying that women's job is only to serve their husbands and children and to stay at home. Don't they know the history of Islam? I bet they do but they don’t want to admit the rights of women. Also one of the aunt saw me going to school wearing uniform and then she complained to my mother saying why I don’t wear Burkha above the uniform. Duh? I'm literally going to school and I have a scarf wrapped around my head. They said how I'm seducing those street men wearing only uniform and not burkha... And whenever a 6 months old get SA'd, they complain about her clothes,like bro she's a kid,she just came to the world. Are all of them like this or It's just my surrounding? \n\nWhat do you think about it?",

So I am student of college and I carry my phone with me as I live very far and get bored on the way to college everyday and carrying a phone also allows me to contact my parents at any certain time. So for my daily commute I take public transport as it is more cheap than the college bus. So today as usual i was on my way back and had my earbuds on my ear and was listening to some song and this random person starts asking me Is my phone allowed in college and I said no it's not allowed I just carry it and obviously I don't go and wave it around my teacher's face, almost 70% of the students carry their own phone. Then he started telling me that if majority people started doing wrong things which are illegal won't be legal. And I said why do you think it's illegal, he says phone has a bad influence over people and people get easily attracted to bad things but I said that's not true. I believe it's in someone's nature, if they wanna do something wrong no amount of strictness can stop them and if someone wants to do something right no amount of bad influence can affect them. But that person kept going on and on about how it's a bad thing and I was getting pissed at this point, I said your thinking is wrong and clearly your from a small town that's why you're thinking is also small but he kept saying it's not wrong and in their times on the institution gate they used to check bags then let them enter but I said your time was different. We are not breaking any major disciplinary act, we have phone we keep it in our bag don't use it in the middle of class not disturbing anyone anyhow with my phone only use it on my way how am I doing something wrong. He's saying no I lived in Dhaka for last four years, I am in Dhaka city college, I kept telling him that you are not right and I am not obligated to answer you but he's saying I am giving a right advice to you because apparently using a earbuds wearing a uniform leaves some kind of bad mark to the name of students according to him. He wasted my time and made my ear bleed with his nonsense.\n\nHonestly I don't think phone is breaking any kind of discipline and nowadays teacher are aware that everyone has phones but they don't say anything cause somewhere they also understand some people need it as they need to contact their parents alot and by carrying it we are not doing anything wrong. Yea if someone uses it in the middle of class or exam it's wrong but if it's only kept in bag and only used outside educational institution I don't think it's bad any how and EM schools allow phones and alot of colleges started allowing phone to. Teacher coming to classes and for no reason checking bag and taking a phone should not be encouraged. And the random guy I met has very regressive thoughts and I think people like him are the reason our country is regressing and not progressing, but yea do let me know what you guys think",

What are the essentials? I'm talking styling, accessories, where to even find this stuff without breaking the bank or relying entirely on imports.\n\nSome things I'm curious about:\n\n* Layering in Indian weather (because let's be real, black in the Dhaka summer hits different)\n* Accessories that actually work - rings, chains, chokers?\n* Boots vs. regular footwear - what's practical here?\n* Thrifting vs. online vs. tailoring custom pieces?\n\nI feel like most goth fashion guides are super western-centric.

        "title": "Dhaka English Medium Schools: Playgroup Admission Info",
        "body": "\nI have collected data on the admission costs and monthly tuition fees for PLAYGROUP at several well-known English Medium schools in Dhaka. Since the cost and fee structures for most of these schools are not publicly available, I am sharing this information to help other parents of young children.\n\nBased on the costs, these schools can be generally categorized into three tiers. Schools in the Budget-Conscious Category typically have tuition fees ranging from 8k-12k per month. These include Averroes, Playpen, Hurdco, Canadian Maple, Maple Leaf, Southbreeze, Manarat, BIT etc. You should expect to pay a one-time admission fee of between 100k and 150k during enrollment.\n\nI am calling the next category of schools Mid-Range (though sounds insane considering the cost). These schools are generally regarded as some of the best English Medium schools in Dhaka, with monthly fees between 17k and 25k. The schools in this tier are Sunbeams, Sunnydale, Glenrich (DPS STS), Sir John Wilson, Scholastica, Mastermind, International Hope, Chittagong Grammar, Singapore Kinderland etc. The initial admission costs for these schools are approximately 170k to 250k.\n\nAbove the mid-range are the more Premium Category schools. Like Springdale: Annual Tuition Fee 400K, AUSIS: Annual Tuition Fee 460K, Aga Khan: Annual Tuition Fees 650K. Admission costs of these schools are around 300k-400k.\n\nFinally, there are two God Tier international schools with fees quoted in USD: For ISD (International School Dhaka), the Admission Cost is approx. $9,000 and the Annual Tuition Fee is approx. $7,000, making the total cost for the first year around $16,000. For AISD (American International School Dhaka), the Admission Cost is $17,500 and the Annual Tuition Fees are $17,500. The total cost for the first year alone is approximately $35,000, which is close to 44 lac BDT.\n\nIt is worth noting that the one-time Admission Cost is often equal to the school's Annual Tuition Fees. Additionally, parents typically incur an additional 15% to 20% in other expenses on top of the stated tuition fees, covering costs like books, stationery, extracurricular activities etc except transportation. Transportation would cost extra 8k-10k per month.\n\nCurrently, the most competitive admission processes are found at Sunbeams, Sunnydale, and Sir John Wilson. Since the academic session starts in July for these schools, the admission process for Playgroup typically begins in August of the previous year. Child needs be within 3-4 years old on 1st July for Playgroup Admission.\n",

The entire world is calling this case a *miscarriage of justice*. The world says this case will remain an example of a farce in the name of justice. Police may apply “proportionate force’’ to protect state property and safeguard the lives and property of citizens. That is still happening—perhaps even excessively.\n\nIn Gopalganj, not a single police or army member was even slightly injured, yet during a political program there, 5–6 people were killed by the excessive force used by the current Yunus government. This is genocide.\n\nMeanwhile, from BTV, metro rail, Setu Bhaban, toll plazas to across the entire country, hundreds of businesses and vehicles were destroyed; prisons were attacked and militants–terrorists were freed. Police officers were beaten and hung. In response, actions taken in self-defense have now been turned into fabricated, baseless accusations to stage executions. Yet this makeshift “lawyer” claims no law was violated. Time will tell what was lawful and what was not.\n\nThose who are helping this illegal government and their militant allies will be punished under the existing laws of Bangladesh. That will be done through an “expedited” trial. There is nothing left to prove—everything is already proven.\n\n[Source](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1AHkQM7e2H/)",

        "body": "Hey everyone!\nI’m looking to buy a 512GB M.2 2280 NVMe SSD (PCIe 3.0 or 4.0 x4) within a budget of 5,000 BDT.\n\nMy use case:\n\nMainly playing Wuthering Waves\n\nWant the SSD to last 3–4 years\n\nGood stability + consistent performance\n\nNot super heavy workloads (mostly gaming + normal usage)\n\n\nMy main question:\n\nShould I increase my budget to buy a DRAM SSD, or will a DRAM-less SSD within 5k still work fine? Right now I’m using a 128GB SATA SSD that’s also DRAM-less.\n\nShould I go for a DRAM SSD, or is a DRAM-less SSD fine in this price range?\n\nIf you know any reliable models under 5k, preferably good brands available in Bangladesh, please suggest!\nThanks in advance 🙏",

        "title": "Should I Do a Master’s/PhD Abroad? Average Student, No Passion, Married, and Scared to Go Alone",
        "body": "\nHi everyone,\nI’m really confused about my future and need honest, experience-based advice from people who’ve studied abroad.\n\nA bit about me:\n\t\n•\tI’ve always been an average-but-capable student. I’m not the type who studies out of curiosity or passion, but if something needs to be done, I do it properly.\n\t\n•\tMy parents pushed me to study my whole life, so academics became a routine, not a passion.\n\t\n•\tI got into a top engineering university in Bangladesh and kept a CGPA above 3.5, mostly by studying hard during finals and class tests.\n\t\n•\tI did my undergrad thesis seriously and completed it well, but I don’t have the drive to turn it into a publication now.\n\nHere’s the key thing about me:\nIf I have to study something — even something I don’t enjoy — I will sit down, push through, and complete it properly.\nDifficult course? I’ll grind through it.\nBoring topic? I’ll still learn enough to get a good result.\nI’m disciplined when required, just… not naturally passionate.\n\nBut I’m also someone with no specific research interest. No favorite field. No topic I feel excited about. I don’t enjoy reading research papers. I don’t have that “curiosity spark” people talk about in academia.\n\nAnother important piece:\n\nStudying has always been my comfort zone because that’s all I’ve ever done. I didn’t participate in extracurriculars, clubs, or competitions. My entire life has basically been “study and survive.” So whenever I’m lost, my mind automatically goes back to, “Maybe I should study more.”\n\nRight now I’m genuinely stuck:\n\n•\tI’m not applying to private jobs.\n\n•\tI’m not studying for government jobs (and        honestly, those don’t attract me at all).\n\n•\tI’m just drifting without direction.\n\nEmotionally, things are complicated:\n\n•\tLiving away from home in undergrad was difficult.\n\n•\tEverything became easier after I married my long-term partner because he was there with me.\n\n•\tI also had close friends who studied with me, discussed everything, and kept me motivated.\n\nIf I study abroad, I’ll be alone — no husband, no built-in support system, no study group.\nAnd since I’m already unsure about academics, the idea of managing studies + loneliness feels terrifying.\n\nSo I want honest answers from people who’ve actually lived this:\n\n1.\tHow hard is a Master’s or PhD abroad for someone like me — disciplined enough to get work done, but not passionate?\n\n2.\tIs it risky to start a research degree when you don’t have a specific research interest?\n\n3.\tDo people find passion later, or is that just a comforting myth?\n\n4.\tHow emotionally tough is life abroad when you’re married but going alone?\n\n5.\tCan someone like me actually handle the pressure, or is this setting myself up for burnout?\n\n6.\tShould I work for a while in Bangladesh to understand myself before deciding?\n\nMy thoughts are all over the place, and I’m really lost. Any honest advice would mean a lot.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

        "body": "My wife — along with her mother and sister — is often very mean and rude to others. Her mother used to hit the household help, and my wife grew up seeing that. She knows that I dislike such behavior, but she continues doing things that are hurtful. She doesn’t get along with anyone: not with my mother, not with her own mother, and not with any helping hand. She behaves as though everything must go exactly her way, immediately, without consideration for others.\n\nRecently we hired a helping hand to take care of our daughter, and my wife made her life extremely difficult. She treated her very harshly, almost like she wasn’t a human being. She used very hurtful language toward her—for example saying things like *“Khodar khasir moto khacche bose bose”*. The truth is, the girl didn’t even eat much, and even if she did, I don’t understand why it would be a problem. I believe that rizq is from Allah, and by His grace and mercy I can afford the household expenses. I have repeatedly asked my wife not to behave like this, and especially not to make comments about someone’s rizq. It is her provision from Allah; we have no right to question it. But my wife didn’t care.\n\nIn the end, to protect the helping hand from more mistreatment, I convinced my wife by saying that the girl was not doing anything important, and maybe we should send her home. My wife agreed, and we sent her back. When she was leaving, the girl was crying — and it really broke my heart. I feel terrible, and sometimes I cry privately in the bathroom so my wife doesn’t see it. I don’t know what to do. Is this normal? Do most families treat their helping hands this way? When I was growing up, we never had household help. We weren’t financially well off back then, and my mother did everything by herself.",

He is worried now because he heard from somewhere that a student can only attend HSC 3 times. He cannot ask the college authorities because they treat them harshly and he is ashamed to face his professors and juniors. So can anyone inform me if its possible to attend HSC for the 4th time? It would be really helpful for him if someone could answer this question",
